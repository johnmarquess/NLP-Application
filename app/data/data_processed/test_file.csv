Comfort Intense Fresh Sky Fabric Conditioner 38 Wash 570ml,5,"The hype attached to the scent of fabric conditioner is something as a family we ignore. All we want is for the clothes to smell fresh and pleasant after a wash, to be soft and comfortable to wear and for the product to be economical. Fortunately, this one fulfills all the criteria. When I say 'to smell fresh and pleasant' I don't mean stink the place out with the scent and overpower and wilt everything in a 100 yard radius. Again, fortunately, this doesn't do so and so gets a general thumbs up, but I could have done without the wording bigging up the wonderfulness of the smells. To me that's an alarm call not to purchase! I'll whisk myself away with my own favourite perfumes.

Persil & Comfort New Baby Essential Laundry Kit(3 Items),5,"These are gentle, skin-kind versions within the Persil and Comfort ranges. The bundled pack is a practical suggestion that offers good value compared to the individual retail prices of 2x25 wash Persil and 1x38 wash Comfort, making the fabric softener effectively free. I can't remember not using Persil non-biological as my laundry detergent of choice, it's the brand I grew up with - one that doesn't irritate the eczema and allergy prone skin of several members of my family. It has a pleasant, but not overly dominant scent, and the fluid formulation means this can be used even on cold washes. The Comfort is a highly concentrated version in quite a small bottle. In real life, the bottle is rather smaller than the product photo makes it appear in relation to the Persil, but this doesn't represent poor value (38 washes worth is 38 washes worth regardless of the size container in which it comes) and the small size does a good job of keeping the use of packaging materials down.","['gentle', 'skin', 'kind', 'version', 'persil', 'comfort', 'range', 'bundled', 'pack', 'practical', 'suggestion', 'offer', 'good', 'value', 'compare', 'individual', 'retail', 'price', '2x25', 'wash', 'persil', '1x38', 'wash', 'comfort', 'make', 'fabric', 'softener', 'effectively', 'free', 't', 'remember', 'persil', 'non', 'biological', 'laundry', 'detergent', 'choice', 's', 'brand', 'grow', 'doesn', 't', 'irritate', 'eczema', 'allergy', 'prone', 'skin', 'member', 'family', 'pleasant', 'overly', 'dominant', 'scent', 'fluid', 'formulation', 'mean', 'cold', 'wash', 'comfort', 'highly', 'concentrated', 'version', 'small', 'bottle', 'real', 'life', 'bottle', 'small', 'product', 'photo', 'make', 'appear', 'relation', 'persil', 'doesn', 't', 'represent', 'poor', 'value', '38', 'wash', 'worth', '38', 'wash', 'worth', 'regardless', 'size', 'container', 'come', 'small', 'size', 'good', 'job', 'keep', 'use', 'packaging', 'material']"

Persil & Comfort New Baby Essential Laundry Kit(3 Items),5,"I used Persil non-bio for many years, but changed to a brand specifically for babies about eight years ago, so it was a bit of a homecoming using it again. I really like the flip-top opening and how smoothly the product pours into the dispenser ball, which is much easier than the crosscut design on my usual brand that requires a fair amount of pressure. I never had a problem with how well Persil cleans, and this hasn’t changed; a machine load of baby clothes – together with stains - muslins and bedding came out spotless. With the addition of the Comfort Pure conditioner, the laundry was very soft and smelled lovely. It also performs well on general washing. I have decided to go back to using Persil non-bio; not just for the frustration-free dispenser, but it performs so well and is kind to skin.

Comfort Intense Fresh Sky Fabric Conditioner 38 Wash 570ml,4,"I was a bit worried that a product called 'Intense' might leave an overpowering scent on your laundry, who wants to walk around smelling of fabric conditioner? Thankfully it's not like that at all and the scent it leaves is fresh and quite subtle (once dry) and lingers around without being too pervasive. The Fresh Sky fragrance is appealing and not too chemical-like with a fruity/floral mix. For me, it suits household items more than clothes, things like towels and bed linen are left softened and fresh-smelling. I appreciate the small bottle size and concentrated liquid and that it has less environmental impact but I do think that the concentrated liquids are less effective at softening than the more dilute liquids are. If you're looking for the best softening then consider a full-sized bottle but if you prefer a more subtle softening effect but the same fresh fragrance then this concentrated version is a great buy.","['bit', 'worried', 'product', 'call', 'intense', 'leave', 'overpower', 'scent', 'laundry', 'want', 'walk', 'smelling', 'fabric', 'conditioner', 'thankfully', 's', 'like', 'scent', 'leave', 'fresh', 'subtle', 'dry', 'linger', 'pervasive', 'fresh', 'sky', 'fragrance', 'appeal', 'chemical', 'like', 'fruity', 'floral', 'mix', 'suit', 'household', 'item', 'clothe', 'thing', 'like', 'towel', 'bed', 'linen', 'leave', 'soften', 'fresh', 'smell', 'appreciate', 'small', 'bottle', 'size', 'concentrated', 'liquid', 'environmental', 'impact', 'think', 'concentrated', 'liquid', 'effective', 'soften', 'dilute', 'liquid', 'look', 'good', 'softening', 'consider', 'sized', 'bottle', 'prefer', 'subtle', 'soften', 'effect', 'fresh', 'fragrance', 'concentrated', 'version', 'great', 'buy']"

Just how concentrated the product is can be sensed from the fact that you can detect the scent before you even open the bottle. When you do, don't breath deeply (as I did), it's overpowering. However, in it's more dilute form (just half a cap per load), it does add a pleasant, attractively ""flowery"" aroma to your clothes. All scents will be a matter of taste, but we like it and our washing feels soft and pleasant (though we were already regular Comfort users). In this form the product represents good value for a quality product and for those who want to lessen their impact on the environment (albeit in the smallest of ways), there's something for you here, too.","['clearly', 'late', 'product', 'variation', 'comfort', 'address', 'environmental', 'concern', 'plastic', 'waste', 'product', 'highly', 'concentrated', 'come', 'small', 'bottle', 'recycle', 'reduce', 'packaging', 'transport', 'cost', 'commendable', 'concentrated', 'product', 'sense', 'fact', 'detect', 'scent', 'open', 'bottle', 'don', 't', 'breath', 'deeply', 's', 'overpower', 's', 'dilute', 'form', 'half', 'cap', 'load', 'add', 'pleasant', 'attractively', 'flowery', 'aroma', 'clothe', 'scent', 'matter', 'taste', 'like', 'washing', 'feel', 'soft', 'pleasant', 'regular', 'comfort', 'user', 'form', 'product', 'represent', 'good', 'value', 'quality', 'product', 'want', 'lessen', 'impact', 'environment', 'albeit', 'small', 'way', 's']"

The washed clothing seems remarkably pleasant to touch and feel. - The specified quantity per wash is smaller than some other conditioners, meaning that a smaller bottle gives plenty of washes.

Comfort Intense Fuchsia Passion Fabric Conditioner 38 Wash 570ml,4,"I love this product. It retains the quality one expects from the well known makers and leaves clothes feeling soft and smelling fresh. The concept of ultra concentrate isn't new as I recall they did one years ago in a tetra type pack. But now maybe public are ready for this innovation. The container is made from recycled plastic which is fantastic and refillable. It is also recyclable but the sleeve isn't which is a disappointment. I'm hoping the refill packs are from a more cardboard style pack though and fully recyclable. I'm glad it has a dose counter as it seems so much less to use it would be easy to put in too much if it wasn't there. My other half and I have sensitive skin and this was fine for us to use. I found it hard to read the small print on the wrapper even with magnification glass. But I couldn't see anything to say if it was tested on animals or if any animal products used in the making. Although this is not a food product these are issues that are important for many. Whilst it provides details of the headquarter offices it doesn't actually say where its produced, I think this would be helpful to know as for many people myself included would prefer to buy products made in country of sale to reduce carbon footprint. I am a little torn about this product as if it was a washing powder or liquid and comfort softener combination I can't help thinking that cuts down packaging and carbon footprint further and can be better value.

The bottles are reasonably good value as a little goes a long way - A half capful is recommended for washes of 4-5 kg, and a full capful for larger washes. There are 36 washes based on the half capful dose for 4-5kg loads, so as I usually do larger loads I should get approximately 18 washes per bottle.

Comfort Intense Fuchsia Passion Fabric Conditioner 38 Wash 570ml,5,"I did a large amount of laundry yesterday and was immediately impressed with the scent of this fabric conditioner. Fuchsia Passion is delightful, such a lovely scent. As this is ultra concentrated you only need a little amount. I tumble dried most of the clothes and they came out soft and smelling lovely. I often find the tumble dryer makes laundry lose any scent but not on this occasion. I dried some clothes on a clothes horse and was delighted that the whole room took on a lovely scent. I am very impressed that Comfort have concentrated their fabric conditioner and are using recycled plastic in the bottle to cut the amount of plastics used. The whole bottle bar the wrapper is recyclable. The bottle is small (see picture) but as it is ultra concentrated it still lasts as long as a larger bottle.

Comfort Intense Fresh Sky Fabric Conditioner 38 Wash 570ml,4,"I've not used a separate conditioner in years, because most washing products these days seem to do it all. I hadn't realised how much of a scent boost a separate fabric conditioner delivers, and how much it actually does soften the wash. The bottles - 6 of them, and not 8 as the ad states, come in a compact box and tbh, that itself could be used to deliver the products in, rather than having that placed in an Amazon box with more paper wrapping. All of the packaging, including the empty bottles, can be recycled. You don't waste any of the liquid, as the top of the bottle is well designed to minimise spillage and so that you can pour just what you need (half a capful is recommended, but I went with a little more), and not a gush of liquid from a large spout. I've had to dry indoors today due to the weather, and my whole house smells of this. I'm really impressed with this, and even for 6 bottles rather than the stated 8, this is good value for money. I also like that the small bottles mean that I can store them on a lower shelf for heavier items, rather than risking my under-sink shelving collapsing (yes, it's happened more than once!). Just don't squeeze the bottles hard, as they're made from recycled plastic and are a little flimsy-feeling.","['ve', 'separate', 'conditioner', 'year', 'washing', 'product', 'day', 'hadn', 't', 'realise', 'scent', 'boost', 'separate', 'fabric', 'conditioner', 'deliver', 'actually', 'soften', 'wash', 'bottle', '6', '8', 'ad', 'state', 'come', 'compact', 'box', 'tbh', 'deliver', 'product', 'have', 'place', 'amazon', 'box', 'paper', 'wrapping', 'packaging', 'include', 'bottle', 'recycle', 'don', 't', 'waste', 'liquid', 'bottle', 'design', 'minimise', 'spillage', 'pour', 'need', 'half', 'capful', 'recommend', 'go', 'little', 'gush', 'liquid', 'large', 'spout', 've', 'dry', 'indoor', 'today', 'weather', 'house', 'smell', 'm', 'impressed', '6', 'bottle', 'state', '8', 'good', 'value', 'money', 'like', 'small', 'bottle', 'mean', 'store', 'low', 'shelf', 'heavy', 'item', 'risk', 'sink', 'shelve', 'collapse', 'yes', 's', 'happen', 'don', 't', 'squeeze', 'bottle', 'hard', 'recycled', 'plastic', 'little', 'flimsy', 'feeling']"
Magnum  Double Raspberry Ice Cream 3 x 88ml,2,"If I was a wild-eyed enthusiast and was asked to rate free Magnums as part of a promotion I'd perhaps err on the generous side. As a paying customer, however, these are nothing to write home about. There's an uncomfortable flavour clash, between the dark chocolate coating and the sickly sweet raspberry sauce which covers the core, that's difficult to describe. The core itself reminded me of the cheapest imaginable insipid, own brand raspberry ice-cream with little of the smooth creaminess you find in other Magnums.

Persil & Comfort New Baby Essential Laundry Kit(3 Items),4,"In this ""kit"" for sensitive skin you get x2 Persil non-biological washing detergent (potentially 48 washes) and x1 ultra-concentrate Comfort Pure (potentially 38 washes). I say potentially because if you are doing larger loads you'll need to increase the amount you use. We tend to alternate between Fairy and Persil non-bio, not only because we have young children but also because some family members have sensitive skin. We've never had an issue with someone having a reaction due to Persil, it's probably our preferred brand. We don't use Comfort Pure all the time because some members of the family don't like how it leaves their clothes feeling (too soft!), but we do use it on the children's clothes because it leaves them nice and soft. Both products in this kit are endorsed by the British Skin Foundation. Price for the kit at the time of writing the review is £11, this is slightly more than you would currently get the individual products in some supermarkets (£3 for each product).

Comfort Intense Fresh Sky Fabric Conditioner 38 Wash 570ml,5,"Clearly this latest product variation from Comfort is to address some environmental concerns and plastics waste. The product is highly concentrated, so comes in a smaller bottle that is itself recycled. Reduced packaging and transport costs. All very commendable. Just how concentrated the product is can be sensed from the fact that you can detect the scent before you even open the bottle. When you do, don't breath deeply (as I did), it's overpowering. However, in it's more dilute form (just half a cap per load), it does add a pleasant, slightly zesty aroma to your clothes. The scent will be a matter of taste, but we like it and our washing feels soft and pleasant (though we were already regular Comfort users).

Persil & Comfort New Baby Essential Laundry Kit(3 Items),5,"My wife has extremely sensitive skin, which I never believed until I inadvertently washed some of her clothing in a different detergent. On that basis, she has used either Persil or Fairy products for our joint laundry for many years. Combine that with the fact that we cannot use biological products as we have a septic tank, this product is ideal. The detergent is dispensed into a capsule which is inserted into the main body of the product and then placed on top of the laundry. There is sufficient detergent for 48 washes from the two bottles. The detergent is complimented by a fabric conditioner, which is measured out into the fabric compartment softener on the washing machine; there is sufficient to condition 24 washes. Both products have a pleasant ""clean"" fragrance and leave clothing smelling fresh and soft after drying. A really good product for those with sensitive skin and competitively priced against normal supermarket prices.","['wife', 'extremely', 'sensitive', 'skin', 'believe', 'inadvertently', 'wash', 'clothing', 'different', 'detergent', 'basis', 'persil', 'fairy', 'product', 'joint', 'laundry', 'year', 'combine', 'fact', 'use', 'biological', 'product', 'septic', 'tank', 'product', 'ideal', 'detergent', 'dispense', 'capsule', 'insert', 'main', 'body', 'product', 'place', 'laundry', 'sufficient', 'detergent', '48', 'wash', 'bottle', 'detergent', 'compliment', 'fabric', 'conditioner', 'measure', 'fabric', 'compartment', 'softener', 'washing', 'machine', 'sufficient', 'condition', '24', 'wash', 'product', 'pleasant', 'clean', 'fragrance', 'leave', 'clothing', 'smell', 'fresh', 'soft', 'dry', 'good', 'product', 'sensitive', 'skin', 'competitively', 'price', 'normal', 'supermarket', 'price']"

Comfort Intense Fuchsia Passion Fabric Conditioner 38 Wash 570ml,5,"This listing is for a pack of 8, concentrated fabric softeners, although I received a sample for review purposes. Note that the container is made from 100% recycled plastic and is suitable for further recycling, but you do need to remove the plastic wrap that holds the product information (once the bottle is used up, as you need it beforehand for dosing information). I found I needed to use a jar opener to remove the lid for the first time; I guess that is good when you are receiving this via the post as it means there is less chance of the lid coming loose and spilling contents into the parcel rather than onto your clothes. I like the scent, which transfers well to laundry and leaves it smelling floral without being overly sweet. It would be worth sniffing in a shop before committing to a large pack however, as not all laundry scents are to everyone’s taste. The softness is fantastic, particularly noticeable after laundry has been dried outside, which normally makes it feel stiff. A bottle will cover up to 36 loads (4-5 Kg), you will only manage 16 larger, 6-7 Kg loads. The bottle looks small, but the liquid is very concentrated, so do use the dosing cap rather than just pour into the machine as you will otherwise use too much (probably).","['listing', 'pack', '8', 'concentrated', 'fabric', 'softener', 'receive', 'sample', 'review', 'purpose', 'note', 'container', '100', 'recycle', 'plastic', 'suitable', 'recycling', 'need', 'remove', 'plastic', 'wrap', 'hold', 'product', 'information', 'bottle', 'need', 'dose', 'information', 'find', 'need', 'use', 'jar', 'opener', 'remove', 'lid', 'time', 'guess', 'good', 'receive', 'post', 'mean', 'chance', 'lid', 'come', 'loose', 'spill', 'content', 'parcel', 'clothe', 'like', 'scent', 'transfer', 'laundry', 'leave', 'smell', 'floral', 'overly', 'sweet', 'worth', 'sniff', 'shop', 'commit', 'large', 'pack', 'laundry', 'scent', 's', 'taste', 'softness', 'fantastic', 'particularly', 'noticeable', 'laundry', 'dry', 'outside', 'normally', 'make', 'feel', 'stiff', 'bottle', 'cover', '36', 'load', '4', '5', 'kg', 'manage', '16', 'large', '6', '7', 'kg', 'load', 'bottle', 'look', 'small', 'liquid', 'concentrated', 'use', 'dose', 'cap', 'pour', 'machine', 'use', 'probably']"

It is nice to be able to fit the bottles in my kitchen cupboard! I did find that half a cap was enough.

This is a really quick way to use up a small 540 ml bottle….but….if you use the cap as a measure as it is supposed to be…..then you will find it is a very economical way to use the conditioner! Very cool fragrance which actually carries through to your clothes, making you smell like a Fresh Sky – if you know what such a thing smells like?

So I shopped around to find a cheap but known brand and found these in subscribe and save. We’re using them every few days and can say we are quite happy with them. They smell nice but not over powering, leave no residue in the drum or on clothes, come in refill packs so I can top up my container and then the bin isn’t full of powder boxes and they are easy to use as there’s no question over how much to use. Also as a plus, they don’t seem to bleach clothing as I found happened occasionally when using powder that got “stuck” in clothing and not rinsed out properly.

"Persil Powercaps Non Bio Washing Capsules 38 Wash, 1026g",5,"Some things in life are enjoyable to buy and some things plainly are not. No matter how pretty the product and how bright and bold the actual washing detergent is, it will always be a grudge purchase. No one likes to have dirty smelly clothes and wash powder / tablets / capsules are a necessity that makes a hole in everyone's weekly grocery budget that could be better spent on something interesting such as cakes or exotic vegetables that you have to look up how to cook. Along with Ariel, Fairy and Bold, Persil is one of the big brands that dominant the market for detergents. It is owned by global consumer products giant Unilever who are experts at branding and marketing. It is refreshing to see these capsules at such reasonable value., they work out 15p each which is an absolute bargain. Even the dodgy imitation ones you find in sub prime supermarkets are more than these, and the great thing about Persil is that you can guarantee that the product is going to be high quality. These capsules come in a rubbery gossamer coated casing containing a different brightly coloured gel like liquids in each of the four compartments.

Vaseline Intensive Care Aloe Soothe Body Lotion 400ml,5,So prior to receiving this I had pretty rough elbows in particular and my skin feels dry. As a busy mum of two I admit I sometimes neglect myself.. some of you may empathise! But this product trial gave me the perfect opportunity to reconnect with myself and have a bit of \u201Cme time\u201D. So for 3 days after my baths / shower I smothered myself with this. I must admit the first time I put this on I wasn\u2019t sure about the smell. It\u2019s not offensive it\u2019s like a cucumber smell (although it\u2019s aloe) but I tend to smell of perfumes all the time.. however by day 3 I actually liked the smell. Application: it went on nicely not too thick and soaked in pretty quickly it didn\u2019t feel sticky.

Vaseline Intensive Care Aloe Soothe Body Lotion 400ml,5,So prior to receiving this I had pretty rough elbows in particular and my skin feels dry. As a busy mum of two I admit I sometimes neglect myself.. some of you may empathise! But this product trial gave me the perfect opportunity to reconnect with myself and have a bit of \u201Cme time\u201D. So for 3 days after my baths / shower I smothered myself with this. I must admit the first time I put this on I wasn't sure about the smell. It's not offensive it's like a cucumber smell (although it's aloe) but I tend to smell of perfumes all the time.. however by day 3 I actually liked the smell. Application: it went on nicely not too thick and soaked in pretty quickly it didn't feel sticky. I always have my morning wash by 07:30 but even in the evening before bedtime my skin is feeling noticibly softer and my rough elbows gone. Verdict: thumbs up.

Also I found that I could apply makeup easily within a short period of time as the moisturiser sunk into my skin easily.
