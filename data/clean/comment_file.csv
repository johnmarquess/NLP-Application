Simple assessments which require Regional Director approval require a briefing note in addition to the assessment. The briefing note is unnecessary and duplicated the information in the assessment. Additionally the process then required the involvement of various AO's and admins to vet the brief which is a inefficent use of time and resources. This is a daily requirement in our region. 
Simple home garaging requests involves too may approvals for a simple and low risk request. 
The reduction from travel approval from AO7 to AO6
"The region needs to be more progressive and ask why and does this add value. I see the AO6,  AO7 and regional admin team spending significant amounts of time vetting and forwarding correspondance purely because of established business process which does not manage risk or add value. "
If you have financial delegation then you should be able to approve DTIV's (Direct Tax Invoice Voucher) etc.  Being excluded and instructed that only certain officers can approve takes away a responsibility of your role.
Financial Delegations are allocated as per positions and the person in that position should be allowed to approve to ensure there is no hold up on processing.
NOt really approval/red tape but way too many emails are distributed widely duplicating information and distributing irrelevant information or to irrelevant parties
"Not really approval related but too many emails are distributed and now duplication via teams, too widely. Inefficient matching of content to audience"
"Increase skill levels of officers in preparing reports, corro, briefings etc"
HR reviews (temp to perm; and higher duties reviews) - formal letters to be prepared and hard copies signed by DDG; review templates to be signed by CHRO); mandatory SEAWC checks ie for higher duties reviews require Director level approval (even though it's a mandatory step); EMP process too restrictive
"reduction in 'hard copy' letters, templates, offer and acceptance forms - should all be by email or electronic form"
Unnecessary administration and not productive use of the limited (staff) resources we have available.
MECS is a good tracking system
Need increased use of email and not a reliance on hard copy letters and forms
The need to use the online platform for IT requests 
Fast track decisions. Can be held up in multiple stages.
By not allowing/ensuring delegates manage the FTE & budgets of their team excessive processes have been implemented. 
Would prefer to see better performance management of staff not complying with delegations
Admin approvals should take less than 24hrs.  Too many layered approvals required. Too hard to get higher level delegates to approve things quickly!
Delays in approvals. Required level/delegates for approvals
Bring it back to local management level
redundant information pathways leading to out-of-date guidance
refresh of local info to guide who to go to for what
unclear pathways to follow for approvals as technology or process shifts (reconnecting dept'l process with local application rulesets)
we have old sharepoints running alongside new sharepoints on teams with multiple browsers. we need to refresh at branch levels local process flows
"adaptive to big changes this year in tech platform, staff changes, reporting shifts, a/arrangements (so we can train staff in correct process)"
"use of PARIS to align contracts, finance, HR reporting and Aurion as central conduit to process has helped. not all yet online but getting there. hopefully soon to real-time reporting and for budget build conversations and variance reporting."
scheduled time for branch process capture and recurring meeting to review function (improved governance structure visible to all of branch)
"Travel - travel has been DDG approved in project plans. Before we book travel we seek Director approval, then a form is filled in to add all details into a MECS item which then goes to ED for endorsement and DDG for final approval before we can book. This can take over 1 working week to be finalised hence we miss out on cheaper airfares, vehicles, and accommodation. We often only have short notice for booking travel due to weather and instrument maintenance. Obtaining 4WD vehicles in Mackay is particularly tricky at the last minute. Is it possible to stop at Director level for Covid19 clearance?"
"If the full approval process for travel needs to be done (ie Director, ED then DDG), it would be beneficial for this to be a fully automated system. Staff are also filling in field trip forms for travel, which include approval from their manager, then the travel for these field trips is another separate process. Can they be combined? The time taken between field officers submitting field trip forms and travel being finally DDG approved, can result in more expensive flights, requesting vehicle hire from CTM using non-contracted providers, and more expensive accommodation especially along the coastline during holiday season. If our teams are towing boats, then accommodation that allows parking for 4WD & boat can be booked out in certain areas during school holidays. We try to request early where possible."
"Purchasing stationery, thankfully we can now buy click pens!"
justification of positions for HD; restrictions on backfilling
"Approval times are excessive; having to repeatedly apply for same positions is inefficient, time consuming and often unneccesary"
More consideration for Managers/Directors/ED's input
Sometimes too many people are involved in the same one person process
Technology - sometimes interfacing with too many systems.
"electronic signatures, fewer chains of approval for minor things"
PARIS  (Portfolio Activity Reporting Information System)
Booking approved travel
some correspondence  that is junior and low risk still need Dircetor approval
some grant processes have mutiple approval levels that need fewer
some document checking is done by multiple people duplicating activity
some correspondence is referred to Department  that is answerable by  Ministers office with available information or by doing the same level of googling that  department staff do to answer the question
Bottlenecks can occur as so much has to go through single person  and some is unnecessary
changing the way DTIV's are approved  to an online only process
My branch adding an additional level of detail and approval then what is required by EPP making it almost impossible for travel to occur
Having to complete a risk assessment for any off site meeting and travel  
Approval of minor things by ED or higher
Duplication is just unnecessary and ED approval shouldn't need to be required for minor things like travel (outside of COVID times)
Too many provisions in Regs to consider for deciding applications that are very low risk e.g. commercial activity permits.  
Weak Regulation enforcement provisions results in excessive workload dealing with non-compliant problem clients.
permits required for very low risk activities in parks and forests; 
formally responding to frivolous or vexatious complaints that should be vetted; 
lack of clear policy or procedures results in ad hoc poor decisions; 
"too many untrained people involved in permit decisions, slows down the process, results in backlogs, unhappy clients, responding to complaints...  "
"Inefficient processes and procedures result in excessive work loads for low risk matters that cause backlogs, poor customer service, increase in customer complaints, drop in morale and job satisfaction, health and well-being impacts, "
ESS and QSS is much better than previous systems 
"Base approvals on sound decisions by ensuring decision makers are given accurate and concise advice, based on clear and concise procedures and policies, prepared by well trained technical staff and not numerous people that don't value add to decisions."
Very happy to contribute to solutions via workshops to identify root causes of excessive work loads which aren't necessarily caused by red tape or aren't readily apparent; taking on more and more unfunded work is a good place to start. Time to assert what we are going to stop doing as budgets continue to tighten!
unknown and unrecorded EMP processes for recruitment. Teams have no control over ability to recruit. 
"Clear and transparent local processes for EMP, alerts and reporting"
"There is no clarity, direction or transparceny about what is required for EMP and alerts. "
returning from long leave required several forms to payroll and timesheets in Aurion. It seems they don't talk to eachother so I had to fill out seperate return to work forms. I didn't get paid until both were done.
"duplication, time consuming."
Can timesheets in Aurion be approved in batches of at least two weeks.
I often think that some reporting especially on sharepoint docs is not explained well so it takes some time to work out what is required.
"as per previous comments, sharepoint docs are often difficult to interpret (they are not always set up with the end-users in mind); we usually get to the bottom of things once we ask enough people and spend enough time... which indicates a need for clear wording in instructions."
Love the single sign-on in ESS Aurion!
"Since the drastic reduction in department administrative capacity, red tape has become more prevalent than ever. Unfortunately the department has chosen to engage administrative functions to increase the red tape, rather than provide the administrative staff where it is most needed, to support the efficient functioning of the department. "
There has also been an additional layer added to the executive level which provides another stumbling block in progression of information or approvals processes. 
New online Procurement process
HRM Claims Integrity and Salary & Exp Reports; 
some newly implemented SEQR reporting more suited to ESR than QPWS.....
Online procurement with more documentation than the old version
"Duplication of processes and responses are incredibly inefficient. It seems additional administrative staff in CO has resulted in more of these, which makes the workload of the few out in the Regional areas unrealistic. "
"Processes should be simple, reasonable and non-repetitive and perform a meaningful function. They should also support business outcomes, not hinder. "
"Unfortunately since 2013 administrative functions have become overwhelming, with many functions now having to be carried out by operational / field staff. Rather than learing the lesson, the department seemingly has continued on this path exponetially especially within the covid period. Sadly much of the public perception of the public service is aligning with reality. I am a great advocate of the work on the PS but very disolussioned atm. "
"Asset management, travel documentations/approvals"
Some extra delegations (travel) have been implemented due to COVID and need to be reduced as it is causing confusion and unnecessary work for Director+ where no longer needed.
"My team have indroduced a single form to allow approval for travel that combines WHS, accommodation, flights, home garaging forms into 1 form.  Much less paperwork and reduces how many forms need to be approved by management."
There is a lack of clear direction and guidance out there (online) for applicants (pre-lodgement & authority holders) at the front end (e.g. particularly for drone/UAV use AND Research Permits for State Marine Parks and Protected Areas). 
"If they (permit applicants) can operate fit into compliance with a 'code', we could reduce low risk permits so we can focus more on high risk. "
Also Native Title processes (lack of ILUAs) holding applications up.

"Standard 'Roving' Commercial Activity Permit - Pay & Print version online if your operation can fit within the 'low risk' parameters. 'Class Assessment' for these applications -- this may be able to be applied to Native Title notifications for activities that fit into the 'low risk, low impact' category. Compliance with 'Codes' (e.g. as for small mining operations with MBC, ESR) that are published and externally available -- this could be applied to drone/UAV use. i.e. comply with the 'Code' and notify of intended use/access on Protected Area or State Marine Park, with further consultation and/or permit assessment triggered if outside the stipulated parameters."

"Our Team has to spend a great deal of time and effort reviewing and commenting on various Policies etc. that we work with, although we do not get support or guidance from the ‘Policy Team’. Similarly, we do not seem to get support and guidance for Native Title processes and workload from the ‘Partnerships’ side of QPWS&P. There seems to be a lot of disjointed processes for assessments at the moment (e.g. for Research Permits with Wildlife Team (Protected Animals) and/or Permits Team (Protected Areas), especially after recent Reg changes). The ‘how to proceed’ needs to be addressed (guidelines etc.) so that it can be followed consistently across the teams. Please also read all my previous comments :)  Thank you for the opportunity to provide feedback."
Local SOA and tenders to reduce red tape in low risk contracts i.e clearing and mulching of fencelines; could be done for an area.
QHlth - Hiring Managers/Delegates approval on recruitment flow included their accountability for Funding etc. No requirement for process such as EMP.
"Purchase order amendment process form regional perspective, accompaining board, PR, RD, ED &DDG approvals"
cumbersome and difficult to obtain approvals from each individual in the process
Increase procurement levels requiring tender process to 50k  or 100K for low risk activities or core buisness.
Financial approval amounts too low
"Duplication of effort, poor automation and interface (Connect)"
"Transfer of EAs now will not be undertaken as an assessment process, this will be automated between MMOL and Connect"
Don't repeat electronic and then on line approvals prcesses
Regional procedures in addition to departmental prcoedures that provide no added benefit
Processes have been put in place to support departmental procedures and provide no additional benefit to any level. Just justifies other positions are some level of the spectrum.
Spread responsibilities direct to regional offices instead of directorates. Use directorates for project work rather than every day administrative tasks. 
Job merit list valid from closing date not approval date creating unnecessary recruitment processes.
"Absolute waste of time in terms of approvals, double work-load. The Mineral Business Centre in shocking with its amount of red tape (required by the two managers and the director)"
duplication in procurement processes. 
Inefficient and expensive Recruitment and Selection processes (especially in rural areas where selection pool is limited). 
Overburden on expectations of knowledge in administration processes for junior / inexperienced / staff with other skill sets
"Duplication of processes is a big issue. Great technologies are available, however everyone needs to embrace them, and the Department needs to remove previous options (manual paper based processes for example)."
Timesheets now with Aurion is a success story. However rangers in remote areas need this access.
Remove duplication in approval documents (for example procurment activities). 
"Reduce the 'cut and paste' requirements. Have technology which stores information on organisations, jobs cards etc. so that it is pre-filled when working on a similar yet different project."
"Better delivery of technolgies, including to remote areas, so that the efficiencies and effectiveness of ever improving technolgy can be embraced by all. "
"Redesign the R&S process to engage best fit staff to the position description, not those who perform best in interview or application writing processes (perhaps more acute work tests etc.). Allow time and funds for R&S processes, procurement processes etc. Train staff on expectations of these processes in anticpation that their role desciption will require those tasks (instead of learning at the crunch time when resources and time is poor)."
Selection processes requiring so many forms. 
"Procurement process is lengthy, the digital portal is not any quicker and can create a block if information for one section isn't available at that time, can't move to the next section"
"duplicating information in any system is time wasting and frustrating. Within a department once information has been provided it should not need to be provided again. Ever. Estonia can do it, why can't we?  "
"Procurement as in the last section, has too many areas where the process stalls due to approval or information."
Estonia has a once only policy. If you provide information to the Government once you never have to provide it again. Electronic document sharing and acess is the key.
I think Timekeper works well. 
"Procurement has the potential to work well but needs to allow the person entering the data (doing the procurement) to jump ahead whilst waiting for informatin or a section to be approved, thus reducing stalling of the process."
"As a whole people need to get over their paranoid control issues around information sharing and delegations. Providing the same document 3 times during a HR situation, to the same people and not being able to progress until they have that document is really stuff from the 80's. "
Needing a procedure to communicate between teams throughout ESR. A call/teams chat or email should be all that is needed as we are one department
Where a manual form is provided for an application this results in additional administrative work for the officer. This is not good use of an assessing officers time nor is it a cost benefit to the department to pay up to PO4 pay for administrative work.
"targeted assessment reports have now been formed to provide accurate, legislative reference and allows for an accurate assessment to be completed in a susinct manner."
Ensuring that Department wide it is clear that we have one records system - edocs and hat all documents must be saved into this system with all staff able to search and access this and former electronic systems such as Keeper. This is not clear and does not form part of any departmental induction process and has led to issues with staff not understanding the importance of transparency of government.
Clear processes that are not duplicated are needed.
"Travel still requires approval by DDG.  Surely Directors are responsible enough to approve travel, based on Departmental guidelines. "
"We are required to check staff salary payment details every fortnight!!!!!  This has not been considered necessary for the past 20 years, why is it required now?  It takes about 30 mins every month to do it properly"
There is a plethora of forms required for procurement and it is extremely time consuming to work through them
"Because delegations are too high up the chain, approvals take unnecessary amounts of time.  They also take up the time of busy senior directors."
Allow delegations and approvals at the section level wherever possible
Red tape was reduced for the public but was increased for staff
"Corp comms, too many to mention- every percieved problem adds another layer of red tape instead of looking at a more elegant solution that maybe others already use"
"Corp comms, governance duplication, signing documents when others use OUtlook forms etc"
Instead of physically signing documents the use of digital signin or Outlook forms that automatically go to manager
"Adding bureacratic layers does not make people safer, better governed etc it just provides more stress and more reason for people to want to skip all processes even the good ones."

Record keeping systems - duplication
"Needing to be set up as a vendor to have allowances paid, every time a claim is lodged, when already a paid employee"
Takes too long - and sometimes it is unclear what the approval flow is. 
Empowering levels such as A08 to be a point of approval.  A08 can communicate in a weekly/frequent meeting with Director of what has been approved
encountered unexpected blockers through lack of communication to staff
poor communication both up and down the approval chain leading to confusion regarding processes and responsibilities/delegations
"Grant Payments, if the grant has been approved by a higher level, it shouldn't need the higher level to also approve the payment"
Risk matrix - often smallest risk to government has most excessive red tape
Red Flag Committee for decisions about permit applications over Native Title dertermination areas
Policy/process review - provide us with top-down advice about the extent to which the department is comfortable with granting permits. Clear policy woudl means that we don't have to ask case by case
It is so time consuming to have to refer each application to this (Red Flag) committee  - can delay the permit decsion
Need endorsement/approval at every stage of approval process.
"generally how long it takes to complete a task, processes and approvals process is too drawn out"
"speed the process based on risk. if the work is low risk, then it can go through the excellerated process"
There could be efficiencies made from simplifying these processes. Plus would increase clarity of process
"The collection and collation of specific data is required in numerous ways and with different criteria - for example the collection of grants information is required in 3 different reporting formats - why cannot all the data be held in one central database and all reporting done from that - only enter all the data once and that's done. RAP, QGIP open data portal and grants programs in one instead of 3 reports. One set of approvals required"
"We required a PO person from an employment agency with an SOA. We had DDG approval, an approved budget and an accepted quote from the agency. The procurement process required a total of 10 documents to be completed. Due to time constraints, we didn't go ahead with this option. "
The procurement process needs to be addressed. It's too complicated. It doesn't need to be.
"Procurement processes/procedures are too complicated to understand and follow. Even the flow chart that is supposed to assist us is complicated. In the example I gave re agency with an SOA; even though we had DDG approval, an approved budget and an accepted quote from an agency with an SOA, we were still required to complete 10 documents. How can procurement argue that's a streamlined process? Bottom line: the procurement processes needs to be addressed."
"The ESS system works well (i.e. timesheets, HR forms, leave applications). Very efficient."
Procurement used to be 3 x quotes and the requisition form with delegate approval. That's now been replaced with too many forms. Needs to be streamlined.
Procurement is the best (worst) example of red tape. A separate survey addressing procurement processes should be sent to all staff. 
"Duplication of efforts, too many layers of approval, time delays in getting on with it."
"Need better integration of systems to avoid duplicated efforts, resource staff and provide systems to capture and distribute approved and current text for diverse reporting requirements on the same topic.  "
emp process where budget and fte exist
duplication of info across procurement documents.
"recruitment emp processes add additional work to already busy teams and delay appointment of staff, particularly for temp backfill opportunities.    "
Repetition of info across various procurement documents makes them significantly longer and requires much duplication of effort. 
"enable staff to operate within delegation and hold them accountable, particularly for recruitment"
"Alerts required too often and when submitted, further information is requested as if it was a briefing rather than an alert"
"Matters that are the responsibility of DNRME, Qld Health or WHSQ are too often referred to DES when we have no jurisdiction"
Compliance tasks & KPIs are not focussed on managing significant environmental risks 
Waste reforms have captured too many waste activities that require approvals unnecessarily.
"Types of waste activities were not well considered or appropriately defined to create a rational, reasonable regulatory approval process."
The beneficial use approval/end of waste code provisions have cut some approval requirements and still achieved good environmental outcomes.
"Better clarification of what are the environmental matters that are administered by DES would help to reduce the incidence of inappropriate referrals and ""jurisdiction shopping"" that consumes DES resources. Revise/clarify the list of waste activities requiring approval."
EMP for short HD extensions; EMP for everything
"On the governance/reporting side, there is often duplication of the need to report on an election comittment in a few different places, but with slightly different criteria so there can be inconsitency or duplicate work in that"
"any duplication can lead to challenges and hassle. when a process is split between online and manual, especially with people splitting time between remote and in-person, there is a lot of potential for issues and inefficiencies in that process"
"The senior executive team request urgent briefings via MECS or on a topical issue with less then 24 hours notice, however require approvals to be made by multiple positions then sit on this information resulting in it becoming outdated or irrelevant. This requires the process to be started again adding to more red tap."
"MECS items between myself and DDG requires the approval of an A07, AO8, SO, ED. If there is an issue or question it then feed down all four positions and requires re-approval by all four positions. General briefing material on topical issues requires the same approval process. "
"The excess red tape and approval hurdles required for departmental officers ensure the senior leadership team are informed of issues arising is impacting on the time it takes to make this information known. Due to the time it takes to make it through multiple positions, the issue has either made it to the media or the information is outdated and departmental staff are asked why they are sending outdated information. "
"Senior Leadership Team understand some areas of the department have limited resources and are unable to meet exisiting timeframes when implementing regulatory funtions. By having a simple approval chain will reduce the stress caused to officers who are required to meet statutory timeframes but also being questioned as to why MECS items are late. Change does not have to be big, just an appreciation that the more people required to approve information increases the risk of incorrect or irrlevant information."
Keep it simple and start trusting officers with the information they provide.
Delegation of authority in legislation do not align with business practices. 
Recruitment decisions delegated too high.
Review of business rules to align with legislated requirements.
"It creates inefficiency in service delivery, has lead to loss of good staff, slows workflow, creates redundant work due to long decision making processes (e.g. running an EOI process but not making a decision. It also leads to work being done to address hypotheticals that may not occur while not addressing actual risks."
I've altered business practices to reduce the number of reviewers on a compliance case.
"Ensure that business rules are aimed to delivery obligations as efficiently as possible, and trust staff to make the correct decisions."
Multiple handling & 'post-boxing' of simple MECS approvals.  
Complaints or requests for info that could easily be sorted at officer level.  
Dupliction of procurement processes & info.  
Lack of clarity around HR processes leading to multiple handling 
Procurement was previously much more straight forward to simply get quotes for scope of work or supplies.  In some cases there are delays of many weeks for simple purchasing.  Previously much correspondence was handled with a simple phone call or email but we commonly have dozens of individuals with fingerprints on simple items going up & down the chain for zero value. 
changing positions (at level) within the department required the same paperwork as being a new employee. training records were not transferred so had to do it all again
Reporting monthly on the condition of the work mobile - which was always the same 
"one government HR system, remove bottlenecks associated with assisnging all resposiblity to a single delegate"
Unnessary approvals for authorities
"Red Flag dealings, very low impact activities that require authorities, recruitment process"
"In regard to very low risk authority approvals, we could amend the regulation/s so that an authority would not be required. "
Does the DDG really need to review short-term EOI's? Could this not be approved by the ED? 
I believe we really need ot review our Operational Policies and Guidelines.
Streamline processes so that officers can spend time doing statutory tasks rather than administrative paperwork.
"Community dissatisfy with the time of our actions after we receive a complaint. We need to reduce processes, approvals and make an assessment of what is needed to react to them quicker"
if a level has a HR delegation then they should be able to exercise it without onerous approvals from divisional level.

"Compliance officers identify need to amend EA conditions, report and recommended changes/basis prepared and approved by local compliance manager then higher level compliance manager then passed to assessment team then on to assessment manager "
Tech support help region draft DES contaminated land listing paperwork then to contaminated land manager then back to tech support then back to contaminated land team before send to client 
"Long term enforceable EA conditions have been replaced by fluffy hard to enforce  standard conditions that create very large adminstrative effort to enforce, if at all possible   "
"The levels and number of people needed to make a decision in the compliance sphere, the quality of conditions imposed in environmenal authorities "
"Previously, DES allowed compliance managers to make compliance decisions"
Imposing effective conditions has an indirect benefit in improving compliance inefficiency.  Thinking that quickly pumping out EA with fluffy conditions is effective is a mirage that doesn't look across the departmnet wide impact.  Too many levels of approval creates wastage of effort.
DDG HR processes are directive rather than supportive and end up being bureaucratic rather than problem solving.  
DDG Office finance processes are not consistent and very poorly connected with the program areas that are required to manage the budget eg. no formal process for reporting on variances while unilateral decisions are made within ODDG about returning funds to Treasury without consultation.
A consistent way of managing work flows and record keeping.  Lots of 'urgent' and 'super urgent' requests coming via email making it very difficult to track.  Others coming through MECS which are much easier to handle.
There is too much coming via email when there are really good work flow tracking systems available to remove this block
Putting cabinet briefs in MECS will remove confusing email trails
DSDMIP use TRIM (HPRM) to manage records and work flows - everyone works consistently and it is therefore much easier to manage to deadlines
Part of the issue with red tape is the lack of trust that ODDG decisions and processes are consistent with other areas of the department.  Actions & decisions appear to be inconsistent which causes frustration and breaks trust.  I would like the functions of ODDG to be more customer service focused ie. assisting in resolving problems rather than the problem creators that they currently are.  They may be acting within the 'rules' however it is how that is communicated that could be the root cause of the issue here.
Procurement duplication on forms; TA approvals too high
Financial delegate approvals could be lowered for some things. 
 Procurement duplication on platform and hard copy forms.
"All of the work funnels down to Rangers to do.  If there were more specialised teams like in other govt departments, processes and read tape would appera less. Reducing some tape could increase corporate risk.  For example instead of the rangers having to be project managers, procurement officer, impact assessors, project cost estimators, fire fighters, weed managers etc, there could be a section that completed the impact assessments; designated procuremnet officers (sign off), key project mangers within QPWS etc.  Rangers spread too thin so cutting eveything back seems ideal; however increases risk.  Need more resoources within the dept."
"Working within teams and requirements to get permission from team leaders/managers to access some information. Repetition of reporting about work done, too many track sheets and access to those sheets. Sometime you have to enter information in a sheet but to get access you need permission."
Working within teams and requirements to get permission from team leaders/managers to access some information
May be the managers need to developed some relaxed rules that promote interaction between team members (with teams and outside teams). Encouraging team members to work in different teams (at level or above) will help developing networks and increase efficiency
Encouraging team members to work in different teams (at level or above) will help developing networks and increase efficiency
Use of SmartyGrants but approvals still running on a paperbased briefing system (some duplication and not maximising potential efficencies of the system).  This is a local process.
"Not maximising efficiencies of SmartyGrants, creates duplication of work when seeking approvals as forms need to be filled out in SmartyGrants anyway but still preparing BN's in MECS."
"The process to alter (add/remove/correct) Queensland’s protected area's estate is a rigid and outdated process which takes approximately 14 weeks, this includes the drafting of subordinate legislation and the associated approval requirements involving Treasury and Parliament.  There is a case of a similar process, the making of land as transferable in accordance with the Aboriginal Land Act 1991, which was streamlined down to a two week process that is completed by a Minister’s declaration of relevant land as transferable in place of the entire legislative amendment process.  These two processes were near identical in the nature of the process and the length of time required.  The amendment of legislation to alter Qld’s protected area’s estate is timely, complex, prohibitive, and costly."
"Legislative and approval changes to streamline the alteration process to be undertaken via Ministerial declaration rather than requiring the amendment of subordinate legislation.  This will simplify the process, be cost effective, timely and also ensure DES can keep election commitments (increase Queensland’s protected area estate) and contribute to the social and economic development of First Nation people."
"The current process required to alter Queensland’s protected area estate is outdated, excessively timely, costly, and prohibitive.  Similar processes have been streamlined and it would make the management of Queensland’s protected area estate more efficient. "
The former process to make land transferable under the Aboriginal Land Act 1991 was completed by regulations made by the Governor in Council.  This process was streamlined on 24 May 2019 and has been well received by all Department’s responsible for administering the legislation and dealings affected by the change.
Amend the current subordinate legislation process to replace it with the simple process of a Minister having the power to alter Queensland’s protected area estates via a declaration.
"Car checks using forms that aren't relevant, "
"Compliance hub business rules requiring team leaders and managers to close out cases where no non-compliance has occurred, "
"constantly updating store and use asset forms and flexible arrangement forms, the level of detail some compliance delegates required for statutory tools or notices,"
 reviewing officers who do onerous reviews of work and require multiple versions for wordsmithing which holds up trying to dispatch correspondence
Agreement between delegates and reviewing officers as to the level of detail required for inspection writeups and statutory tools to avoid reworks and make it clear to an officer.

"In terms of recruitment, we at DES and business centre levels does not have a system which captures existing skill set of human resource. If we have that, for recruitments a predefined system can prompt eligible internal candidates as soon as a requirement comes up. this would save workforce time and energy and eliminate bias if any. "
"Documents (including forms, guidelines etc) listed on the policy register not being accessible externally. Requires buisness units to upload to register and then provide another copy of the document for web publishing which is both duplication of content and inefficient use of multiple resources within the department"
Compliance  framework - All of the 5 categories
"Low level compliance issues - Standard for issuing PINS too high, alternate graduated approach not available. Reg stratgey not updated to reflect graduated risk. Risk based regualation not occuring as overly consumed by low risk tasks to comply with reporting and proceedural requirements."
Too much time is spent advising all levels of mgt on matters which have been addressed or considered on multiple fronts in the past. Matters are not progressing if not captured. Accountability for making decisions to not progress the recommended compliance approach.
"Standard conditions in EPAct. This has resulted in new challenges which have not been addressed adequately. Also, streamlinging State approvals under planning Act. Again, problems were caused due to inadequately supporting post implementation challenges. Streamlining can be good, but needs adequate post implementation support which Qld Gov has historically done very porely which impacts directly on the frontline staff."
Getting an online system that works (Dynamics) is the first step. Graduated penalty system. 
"Centralisation of HR decision-making.  Why penalise everyone when there are only a few who don't meet expectations.   Most managers will do there jobs, if only they were left to do it.  And if they don't do the right thing, then take that power away from them.  "
Rules around HR approvals.
They are too centralised.  Devolve responsibility and hold managers accountable.
"It is less red tape, and more good uses of technology.  There are any number of systems that have streamlined things (eg electronic timesheets)"
"Sometimes the approval and/ or decisions making processes are not clear  (Thinking comms, procurement in particular).  I think the push to have greater levels of adminstrative information/forms to be completed at project officer level is actually less efficient. "
MECS items/ correspondence that is sent back to the developing officer to change inconsequential items (such as changing the date on a letter)  
I have had to underake multiple procurements processes using the new procurement portal.  The system is clunky and is cerainly not intuitive to support you accessing the correct templates and paperwork to support your procurement process. 
Generally the broader acceptance of electronic signatures.
MECs - sending items back down the line with minute changes are made to briefs. Excessive approvals for some items that need to happen promptly which result in timeframes being blown out. 
"There are too many approvers, items get stuck with people on leave etc and not progressed"
Approvals for some local signage in the region was reviewed and reduced with all previous approvers endorsement. Much quicker and efficient team and process now
"Consistent approvers for similar items. Clear delegations and lines of communication developed for processes across DES departments. MECs needs to be reviewed so timeframes put into the system are kept on track and not held up. Often the person who writes a brief doesn't see their due dates put in completed, although a matter isn't urgent items taking more than 2+ months to finalise needs to improve. There is a requirement to put in a brief a timeframe if urgent, therfore un-urgent ones have nil listed. Ideally all breifs should be completed within a month or even less if not proceeding all the way to the Minister. Tighter parameters on MECs would allow for this to proceed and essential make processes more effficient. "
"There is clear delegation to approve the launch of a new program or giving out funding. What is not clear is the approval pathway to initiate a project and get buy in along the way. Due to this lack of clarity there seems to be a hodge podge mix of MECs, board, meeting, one-pagers and presentations to give the executives comfort to make a decision. This a lot of time and effort generating the same information in different ways. Happy to be contacted to chat further."
Review and reiterations of the financial management manual has given us clear delegations of who can approve what expenditure of money. 
"Get each branch or team to establish a delegations register that is bespoke to the work they do. This will need endorsement by the ED or even DDG but then all staff are clear on what needs to go where, and executives are freed up for other work. "
IT approvals and unreasonable constraints
IT limitations and controls stopping and slowing work flow
delegations not appropriately applied.  
excessive establisment reporting . Excessive leave reporting 
KPIs on decision/ reveiw turn around times. Delegations approriately applied.
EMP
Recruitment and selction - systems and approvals
The amount of excessive time taken to complete processes. The lack of trust in decision makers. Not allowing people to exercise delegations they have. Micro management.
"If staff have been given delegations to undertake actions, allow them to do so or remove the delegation. Stop imposing processes that actually don't provide any efficiency. "
Current intrastate travel approvals. 
"Approvals outside of MECS as well. We seem to have the same approval delegations regardless of the nature of the advice, type of request. I would not think all internal reporting requires ED or DDG level approvals. "
"In addition, approving small revisions or edits should be at Director level only. No need to take up exec time with these things.   ED and DDG approvals should be focused on external corro, advice to Minister, media only, and annual reporting only.   "
DPC requests for status updates on election commitments can be signed out by Director level and then Corporate Services. 
"Think about a risk based approach to delegations for approvals. i.e. the greater the risk with the item, the higher the delegation of approval. Much of the internal requests for info need only be signed out at Director level. "
Majority of requests recieved have very short timeframes attached or are flagged as urgent. This suggests not enough thought and planning is going in to the drivers of these requests. 
There are are many administrative 'hands' across the executive and ministerial layers 'handling' all the requests. This exacerbates timeframes for meeting requests because so much time has to be allocated to getting it through the system.
"(1) Reducing the number of 'hands' that some requests are required to pass through; and (2) having a strategic approach to corporate and other government or departmental processes that drive requests. e.g. many reporting processes are quarterly or annual and yet still are driven via short/urgent timeframes. These should be planned in advance and early alerts or dates provided to support people to prepare. Recently we have completed reporting on/input to grants program spends, contracts awarded, budget papers input, Estimates etc. "
"The volume and urgency of requests being addressed is significantly affecting morale, resilience and stress levels in our teams. In general, people accept this is part of working in government, but it can be managed better."
A previous department developed an annual strategic calendar that captured key government and corporate cycles that drove many of the requests and then used this to manage the flow of information and consolidating requests for information. Also scope to centrliase reporting. e.g. Procurement Services completing contract reporting centrally.
(1) Make content areas reponsible for the quality of their work instead of applying multiple laters of QA across the system. (2) Centralise and support some aspects of corporate reporting. (3) Better plan and coordinate requests for reporitng and input to be efficient and reduce the total load.
"Like blockers, management taking too long to endorse or approve matters and being vague."
The timeframe for management decisions
Because responding to external stakeholders that management haven't responded can be embarrassing. So you have to be creative in your response.
Procurement for aerial work took approx. 3 months to get approved.
"In some situations, I believe approvals could be lowered (e.g. travel approvals) - though, in some situations, adequate review/governance is not occurring at lower levels, so QA at a higher level is sometimes required."
"Online timesheets have streamlined things. The Region has combined the general travel, home garaging & remote area travel approvals into one form to reduce the need to complete the same info on multiple forms. "
"The Region is preparing a red tape reduction strategy to identify unnecessary or inefficient processes and review procedures, and develop strategies to reduce red tape. The aim is to remove 1-2 red tape processes before adding new processes... without compromising transparency or accountability. "
There are inconsistencies between what officers at different levels are delegated to approve depending on the division.
Room bookings on level 3 of 400G being opened to all users via Outlook.
"Excessive approvals for seeking legal service requests, or for seeking engagement with Compliance Support or RRS. Regarding the legal services request (which is fairly routine), the approvals process resulted in a ‘road block’. "
"Because many approval requests are not automated and may not be actioned/reviewed within anticipated timeframes (or there are no timeframes for actioning some approval requests, leading to ‘road blocks’.  "
"Yes, I've previously contacted compliance support/RRS directly although I'm now aware there's an approvals process which should be followed before they're to be contacted (similar to tech services, for small issues that don't warrant a tech services request I prefer to contact them directly, although I understand this isn't the proper process)."
"Yes, encourage officers to contact agencies directly for small matters (or for advice) prior to embarking on lengthy approval processes (relevant agencies at DES requiring approval (for engagement) include (but are not limited to) tech services, compliance support, RRS, legal services etc.). If the matter is small, and if the relevant agencies is happy to assist (after reviewing the request) that’s great, and a formal approval request (for engagement) may not be required (big time saver). If the issue is more significant, the relevant agency can request that the approvals process be followed, and a proper submission (for engagement) should be made. I’ve often contacted relevant agencies myself to gauge ideas (or for direct support) and this has saved time, although I’m not sure whether this is something that’s encouraged. Before completing a lengthy (and time consuming) request for engagement (i.e. a legal services request or a tech services request), wouldn’t it be better to be able to talk directly with the relevant agency who you’re requesting support from (this is a bit like an applicant wanting to have a pre-lodgement meeting prior to submitting all the necessary paperwork – i.e. potentially a big time saver).

"Because the way they are currently structured creates inefficiencies, in some cases disempowers roles, and requires very senior staff to take their attention of more important tasks to deal with matters that could be administered below them."
"delegate EMP processes down, review HR delegations to push decision making back to levels where responsibility sat several years ago - there has been a rolling up of decision making which makes getting approvals in a timely fashion more difficult and overloads senior staff dealing with administrative matters that previously could be decided below them."
"Delegations for approval of letters, compliance processes are excessively high. E.g. post inspection letter with areas of concern, but no non-compliances should be able to be signed by professional officers. "
"Workflow approval processes are too high, and this creates a bottleneck when those staff are unavailable. Needs to be lower and risk based. "
"To create improved efficiency in the processes, increasing timeframe durations etc."
"A new risk based, streamlined process implemented in the Townsville office to adress NFA matters in realtion to marginal exceedance notfications from local government. "
"Follow deligations identified in legislation, instead of historical local business processes. "
Some human resource delegations need to be reviewed.
I am looking at being able for Commonwealth and State goverment staff being able to undertake higher duties or acting arrangements between the two government bodies without entitlements being affected. Specifically I would need this to apply between QPWS-DES and the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority.
"Standard departmental communication, e.g. website content, should not require Ministerial office review and approval"
Double handling when printing docs for paper files that could be saved electronically
Clear instructions are not always easy to locate
Clear instructions should address why process requires this type of approval to reduce interpretation of process rather than identifying e.g. separation of duties
Better use of automation tools available
Training to help understand the process and reasons in place
be more sepcific by the management when send down the requests/tasks
Business units are often provided insufficient time to complete MECs items as a huge amount of time needs to be allocated for approvals. This means MECs items are often rushed and do not always include the best/most helpful information they should. 
SO much time is take up in approvals. The department would be more efficient and get things done quicker if less time taken in approvals
"Lack of planning around set annual activities (budgets, estimates etc) resulting in staff getting constant SUPER URGENT requests"
"Our WFQ results keep saying that staff are over-worked. We can't manage this locally with all of the adhoc and SUPER URGENT requests for information coming as a barrage down the line. More planning and thought needs to be put into this requests instead of assuming that we should continue to subject our staff to this unplanned, uncoordinated and unreasonable demand for constant information for administrative purposes "
Paul Simshauser as DG of DEWS got rid of timesheets 
"Plan for annual events (estimates, budgets) and push back on timeframes insisted upon by central agencies. It is for them to set a reasonable service standard to political masters. "
"In assessment, there is a large blocker in that all reports etc. must be reviewed by the team leader prior to going to the delegate.  Therefore, it takes the team leader too much time to review the documents - there is a bottle neck."
"Use of eDocs and Connect - duplication of record-keeping which takes a long time.  In addition, Connect is too difficult to use. "
It takes a long time to duplicate record systems - particularly Connect and eDocs.

"Exercise trust in team members to produce a final draft, organise files, templates, etc. "
More refreshing transparency is needed like Karen Hussey's latest update.
We now have multiple communication platforms. Whilst I appreciate the new developments and opportunities to diversify our means of communication I feel that the multi layers of job tracking and messaging adds to the complexity of getting quality work done and meeting the expectation of superior staff. There are many more examples I could provide but this is most pertinent for me.  
"Extra processes add layers of complexity to otherwise simple tasks. I feel it takes me much longer to complete/close out jobs as there are so many platforms it needs to be entered, reported, actioned, opened, closed - all in addition to actually undertaking the assessment and reporting and corresponding that is the essential part of the task. Half the time I can't locate the specific places/entries I'm meant to be reporting. At other times I end up with duplicate entries as several work units are entering tasks as they are received by the department. I feel we have made some progress with technologies lately that are beneficial to the department, but we don't necessarily need to retain them all - especially where processes are duplicated. "
Record keeping and permit generation - required to do processes inside of Connect and duplicate the process outside of it as well due to inadequacies in the system.
"Automation in ERA assessment has proved ineffective. Going through the automation process is required to generate a permit etc., however the actual ability to untertake assessment within this process is severely curtailed, leading to parallel assessment undertaken outside of the process. This is inefficient."
Removal of partial automation of the ERA permitting process through Condition Manager.
Use of a fit for purpose database in place of trying to overengineer adapted workflows through a system; effective use MyDAS as opposed to Connect.
briefing notes/reporting. Minor errors in formatting eg. odd double space and whole doc comes back or get reprimanded for poorly constructed docs. Content should be more valueable then missing one space! 
"I believe the above approval processes need to be review due to un-necessary impact of the delivery of the departments business. Recent changes to financial delegations regionally to manage the lack of budget guidance, means the approval level for all expenditure are un-reasonably high and do not facilitate efficient resourcing.   "
"Whilst I recognise the value in the tracking of documents through MECS, I believe there is un-necessary and in-efficient delays in the progress of items down to the respective division both when the item comes in or when re-work required. Due to the consideration of items at multiple levels, the time afforded to the author is typically significantly reduced by the time take for times to be allocated.  I believe there has been significant investment into the space of duplicated and streamlined work. This however remains a significant blocker for the deliver of efficient and effective work with officers required to record information in multiple systems. Whilst there may be a necessary requirement for these actions to occur, there is a potential for the department to invest in technological advances to improve efficiency. Including the use of AI and Bots to undertake remedial tasks which typically contribute negatively to the perceived red-tape.  "
"Through the implementation of new systems including external interfaces, the department has reduced red-tape required for the approval of some permits and approvals. Furthermore, there are examples of other departments adopting externally facing Bots which will provide responses to customers and clients on simple and questions and enquiries, this reduced the red-tape required for the customer services teams allowing for greater efficiency in resource allocation."
"There is great advancements occuring within the technology section including AI, information mining and Bot creation to take on remidial tasks that would typically fall to a department officer. This is not a process to removed the need for staff but provided an opportunity for more effective resource allcoation to imrove overall efficiency and service delivery. One example of this is the work currently being done by the departments Digital team for which the Northern ESR region has engage. the Digital team is investigating options for infromation storage moving forward including information/record mining to replace a need for individual staff saving departmental records to our record keeping system. This will allow for more efficient record keeping and allow resources to be focus on high priority tasks including investigating environmental harm."
poorly written legislation and/or overly proscriptive policies using a broad brush stroke to apply the policy to all licence holders when could finesse this for less risky activities
EA holders are required to submit a surrender application for relinquishment of sub-blocks on a resource tenure even if there has been no disturbance on those sub-blocks.  Progressive sub-block relinquishment is a DNRME requirement so multiple partial surrender applications required over life of tenure.  DES is required to assess surrender application and issue new version of the permit that is identical to the previous version so no actual change.  A relatively high volume of applications that fit this category are submitted each week 
Establishment management program (EMP) submissions required to fill any position temporarily or permanently rather than trusting management to understand their business and simply set a vacancy management rate target for management to meet.  Management know their business best including which positions to fill and which to leave vacant
inefficient and unnecessary work has to be undertaken with either no material benefit (sub-block relinquishment) or negative outcomes (decisions made about not filling positions without a detailed understanding of the business needs)
whole of DES or whole of Government procurement undertaken for technology solutions so that individual business units don't duplicate procurement process each time a business unit needs to use a solution or refresh procurement for an existing solution
Duplication of corporate card approvals
changing processes when dealing with recruitment
Both manager signoff in Promaster and paper copies required for corporate card.  Some simplified systems would be good for a change
"Comms and web approvals are incredibly burdensome, across the board delegations have been elevated stripping away efficiencies - even when there are sufficient safeguards in place to ensure good decision making."
"Current trends are to centralise decision making to the executive level, stripping away matters that have historically been within scope for Senior Officers/Managers. It is delegitimising the role those leaders play within the organisation.  We have created extra layers of work and a diminishing amount of time available for all of those SO and below to complete it.  This is resulting in delays, additional workload and work force stress."
Previously you have to have Direct Access approval if you want your laptop capable of being used to access information out of the office eg. site or external meetings and work from home
Integrate Automation flow within CHub rather than externally
Inconsistent processes from one office to another. Make it clear where the approval delegation sits and not having another person who doesn't have the delegation be the 1st level of informal approval. 
Too many links in the chain... steps... & then if one of those people are on leave a simple request can take weeks
Streamline. Maybe give supervisors or middle managers more authority
My timesheet and leave requests are endorsed before approval due to my role having 2 lines of reporting. 
Neither the endorser nor the approver are directly affected by my leave absences or are aware of the work I do.
Allow my immediate supervisor to approve my timesheets and leave requests.
Poorly designed processes which overcomplicate things & having to get ED approval for the little things - surely they have more important things to worry about & why do we have all the other layers of Managers if they can't be trusted to make a decision.
"Low value assets/P&E - should be able to be purchased with corp card then registered, instead of the convoluted process used for large assets."
"Even OO3 short term appointment/extension need ED approval, & need RD approval for Rangers to work/camp on park for a few days because of a few $100 TA, surely lower managers are better placed to manage their own budgets & work programs."
It's mainly the HR delegations which are overly cumbersome
"HR approvals are currently at too high a level for the relevant risk/cost, why do we have all these managers if they can't make decisions. "
"P&E/low value asset purchases should be able to be made by corp card - many things worth just over $2000 - pumps, mowers, drones etc can easily be purchased locally by corp card but it's really hard to get the shop to accept the PO process, we should be able to record after purchase as currently happens when Rangers don't realise & purchase on corp card."
"There used to be excessive permitting requirements for public access to State Forests, and Financial Delegations have improved significantly over the years, corporate cards for lower value purchases are a big improvement but should be allowed for P&E purchaes."
"Lower level managers should be able to take more responsibility to temp backfilling of OO3s & travel, all assets/P&E under $10,000 should be able to be purchased by corp card then registered, there is no risk as Finance always pick up any equipment purchases over $2000 on corp card."
"Procurement delegations are reasonable & increase with cost increases, HR approval processes are set too high comparative to their cost & risk."
"Procurement needs to be simplified and streamlined, currently red tape galore "
Clear delegations and amounts and areas of work would help and this would harbour trust and move requests more effectively 
"Team leader was approver and manager of budget, added steps, layers now have slowed effectiveness"
"Yes use of AI forms, with reporting timeframes on approver turnaround time"
Does not value-add to environmental outcomes.  Inhibits real work effort.
"Workplace safety assessment systems are combersome, time consuming and counterproductive. There is an expectation to reinvent the wheel every time for trivial issues. The result is a lack of consistency from using components that have been drawn randomly from flawed previous processes. There has beeen no review and rationalisation. Therefore staff are forced to work around the ""system"" with recuded safety outcomes."
The department has lost its environmental outcomes focus and is bogged down in paperwork with no consistency.
"procurement - ROPAs- multiple times entering same criteria, same details of companies, same reasons to mulitple stages of the procurement process"
reduce amount of time taken
"corp card - partly - expense me app is easy to use and records invoices etc, so helps, but then fin manual still says staff have to print out form and get signed and keep paper copies - when this has already been done electronically "
streamlined procurement processes.
easier to search MECs - there should be a tab where you can bring up all those items you have recently been involved with and not have to search for a term /date etc
The number of hands a BN or similar goes through before it even makes it to the intended recipient. Also numerous times items just make it to a point and sit with that person for an unreasonable amout of tim.
Some appear clunky and archaic. I would like to see a contemporary system that can process a diversity of approval requirements. I would like greater accountability for people to deliver a response within the allocated timeframe.
"Fraedom travel claim. Since staff may use it few times in a year, having to remember all the steps is a nightmare. It would take an admin person who is regularly using the system only few minutes but now it takes hours for each person in  a team to re-learn the system just to forget before the next need to claim. Alternatively, a systematic clear user asissistance with step by step and screen by screen shots and customised for DES claim process can save much time to prepare and ensure less corrections"
"I just want a uniform to be able to do my job, but I require ED approval to enable me to get one. But I see new staff being issued with them. Just an example"
Ordering a uniform.
HR - Work hours
In my field I work outside the normal hours for part of the year. How hard can it be to be able to alter your working hours so that you can do your job!! Not to mention accrued time in leu.
"Get HR to sit down with people on the ground and lissen to them. Policies don't always fit in with everyone, but everyone has to fit in with the policy. How do you get a job done, that your are employed to do, if you are unable to work the hours you are actually required to be there for? It shoud be easier to write in work agreements as long as both parties are in agreement. Not just a few alternatives to choise from."
HR heavy handed interpretation of policy and guidelines eg . recent higher duties appoinment process.
Adds more complexity to what should be a simple process  
1) Having to apply for approval for small amounts (i.e. less than 2 hours) of ATL
2) Needing to re-submit a form just to swap in-office day - no other changes.
3) Having to sign forms for very low risk issues and activities
"4) Adding in phone numbers to briefing notes - no one refers to that area to look for a phone number, they use 1Contact, and we use Teams usually now anyway."
They waste time and don't provide any value.
Remove the need for signatures on low-risk forms.
enforcement decisions
"PINs (other than under delegations trial) - recommendations are reviewed locally, discussed with manager, then sent through MC inbox, reviewed by MC, then taken to MC moderation where they are discussed by multiple MC's - this is a lot of checks in place when our enforcment guidelines provide that these are for minor offences, once off and easily remedied. "
delegation of enforcment decisions to appropriate levels both to empower highly experienced officers and to improve efficiencies
Enforcement decisions need to be made in a more timely manner both to have an impact and to improve confidence in the department. 
In waste levy compliance we trialled a process for issuing PIN's on the spot. Having a checklist that provides for all the elements of an offence to be covered off quickly is an improvement that can be replicated for other enforcement decisions such as the draft DN checklist that is in progress. 
I don't really think we are over-regulated 
"I don't really think it is the level of regulation that frustrates people but rather silos and lack of cooperation. Regulation is necessary and most processes can happen quickly and easily, but if people don't action things then the processes slow down."
"If everyone understands their role in an approval process and performance is monitered, things should move faster. And if they don't, then there should be a reason, such as workload or not understanding the importance of the process."
In the past cutting red tape has been a huge task in itself. Sensible suggestions and inovation should drive red tape reduction without the need to specifically target red tape to reduce.
for effiecency
Repetitive completion of the same form rather than having to fill in once and then be able to manage/update
"Repetitive filling in of forms, not having control over own data but having to update someone else, requiring approval for low risk tasks from senior leaders - not enough trust in staff to do their jobs without excessive oversight."
"When there are quicker ways (and automated ways) to do things, we should be doing it that way. Staff are capable of keeping their own information updated - trust them to do so."
Approval workflows used within DPP for review of documents
Local business rule that I cannot approve leave despite being an A08 - my Director must approve the leave and often times discusses the request with my Executive Director
Procurement delegations conflict between procurement services and local procurement officers - they are contradictory.
Automation - such as with Aurion for HR requests - streamlines processes.
"ALL Compliance processes - policies, approvals, delegations,, local business rules "
All decisions must be signed off by TL or CDM or delegates - completely unnecessary as staff are COMPLETELY capable of making decision. 
"Staff don't have any responsibility and are not empowered to make decisions - all decisions are made at a minimum TL level. This leaves staff feeling strongly disempowered and fuels the high turnover of staff. It also suggests that perhaps ""managers"" don't actually trust the staff.  "
Look outside Qld to the other EPA's
Issuing enforcement tools. Otherwise too much reporting on low risk issues - i.e. the process is the same regardless of the risk. 
Too many cooks in the kitchen. Decisions pass over too many hands. The officer responsible for the re-work often is required to re-work based upon the advice of each reviewer. 
In a local government environment. Interim/non-statutory notices are used to addressed issues on site. Only if the issues aren't addressed would formal tools be used. 
Decisions made locally. More power and decision making ability transferred onto officers. Trust in officers to make the right decisions. 
"The approach should be risk based. Low risk jobs need not get approved beyond team leaders. Delegations allow for team leaders and senior officers to sign notices, however internal procedures prevent decision making at a PO4 level. "
Induction processes are non-existant - need to ensure our officers when they start know what they are doing and are clear on the quality required by the position. 
"If staff are not performing at their level, team leaders/managers need to be educated on everything HR and how to deal with poor performers. "
"Currently approval from DDG is required for any travel prior to any bookings. Other example of Home Garaging Form for QG car, need to fill out the relevant information and then need to send to CDM for authorisation/approval."
CDM not trusting TLs to make lower level decisions (e.g. warnings) creating unneccessary delays in approval proceses and responses to clients
CDMs requiring oversight/approval over all decisions including low level decisions (e.g. warnings) creates unnecessary bottlenecks and implies lack of trust in teams which decreases morale.
Because it slows down actual work being produced. There are too many different processes. 
"All recruitment, acting, HD etc  going through EMP"
Time savings can be made here
"Coming from a Compliance perspective, staff shouldbe trained, provided sufficient guidance, and then trusted to do their jobs, however addressed if hey don't. Too much unnessessary oversight that significantly delays the task, and increases administrative burden that does not aign to risk."
"Trust staff o deliver, however address non-performance if they don't. Don't unnessessarily restrict those that can do their jobs."
"Unnecessary and complex workflows that don't add value to the process, increase cost, and add workload where it is not required. If some areas had problems meeting the standard, address those areas, don't apply processes to everyone that makes all business inefficient."
Budget/travel/HR decisions are (delegation wise) able to be managed at a branch level. EDs should be able to exercise this delegation and manage their own budget/HR/travel decisions.
"Good example is when I produce material it is reviewed by my Team Leader, Manager and Director. Between each of these reviews I am required to revise the document and it becomes very difficult to keep track of where any given document is up to."
"Much of my work is focused around managing the progression of approving of various documents. There isn't any standard process for getting documents approved and appears to be very much driven by who you manager or director is. Further, the existing collaboration interfaces are not implemented in a standard way and it is very much up to the teams to figure out how to make them work in the particular circumstances."
"Before adjusting or implementing a new approval process, write down the actual goals of the process, what are you trying to achieve. Then design a process that is innovative, efficent and does not duplicate processes"
"I think you have stuffed up when designing this questionaire, you are not going to get the feedback your seeking because you are not allowing us to tell YOU what we experience every day from YOU the management. What you should do is ask people to document their frustrations in free form and then you can sifft through those response and figure out which approval process need improving based on the number of responses and also where you can make simple improvements quickly. I think I have just wasted 15mins of my over committed time."

"Allow booking and payment of accommodation by corporate card. We're randomly audited regularly, the scope for illegal activity is extremely low. Corporate cards are signed off by PO5 and PO6's that level is deemed important enough to be paid $100K they're sufficiently responsible to sign off on the vast majority of expenditure, incl accomodation..  "
"Significant approvals have to pointlessly go to the director level. PO5's and PO6's have decades of experience and should be entrusted with 95% of approvals. They're in charge of budgets of millions of dollars, but my application to install microsoft access or create a O365 team has to go above their head. That seems silly.  "
"Systems need to be streamlined and quick and easy process. e.g. new procurement system has been made more complex, more document process and requires manual process before you can go to the next step in the process"
Technology that makes the process easier not more complex and not choosing systems that don't suit and have automated processes.
We need to work more efficiently and have processes and systems to achieve this.
Procurement is a major problem. Capital works proposals are now creating a disincentive for staff to apply for projects./
I'd define blockers as over pedantic supervisors slowing or stopping works/projects being undertaken. Obviously there needs to be due authorization and accountability but often I can't see the value adding in the process.
Procurement thresholds ($10000) needs to be increased to $50000 because cost of basic projects and services often runs over the 10K necessitating full process. The corporate risk is not commensurate with the loss of efficiency and the increased work stress on staff.
Use and processing Corporate Card is a big improvement on past processes. A quantum leap ahead from the (really) old days of requisition and order forms.
"For every new system and process (FLAME, Loc8, Procurement, WHS, HR etc etc) being developed there needs to be an overview as to whether it delivers greater savings and efficiencies in staff time. To my knowledge this has not been done and each new system gets developed in a silo or vacum. There needs to be a holistic approach to managing work loads. "
"The other really basic issue that has the potential to impact negatively on all the operational ranger staff is the ongoing debate regarding timesheets. We stillhave a couple of management areas on a ""trial"" which has been now going for several years. The proposed new timesheet is highly problematic and far less efficient in processing."
"Spending over 2-3 years trying to procure replacement heavy plant that is old/outdated/expensive to maintain/inefficient/unsafe repeating steps multiple times to try to overcome approval processes, get approval at multiple levels only to have the funding removed due to someone in corporate changing their mind is not a good way to do business. In regards to bushfire response, these corporate procurement decisions are going to have catastrophic results for rangers/stakeholders/the environment (as also identified by the independent reviews)."
Consult with field staff regarding requirements in the field. Office staff (generally) are not aware of how things work.
"Budget decisions, procurement"
EMP processes
"MECS is really clunky, often unclear instructions that come through and sent to multiple parties with a lot of wasted time finding the right area, minimal time for briefing officer to draft corrospendence but lots of time given to DG/Minister office.    "
Procurement processes are always reliant on the procurement team who are under resourced or unable to prioritise in accordance with your timeframes. Lead times often mean business areas  can't spend the money they need too.
"some of the formal briefing requirements have reduced, some HR delegations have been reviewed"
"Delegating certain financial decisions to DDG or CFO, rather than the DG."
Certain corrospondence and complaints should not have to be responded to by the business area - i.e. if it just requires an acknowledgement letter or a response isnt required at all (i.e. web based notifications through website saying the Connect is down etc) then this should be able to dealt with by the central corro unit and not fill up mecs. So much time and effort is wasted when something is sent to a business area to respond only to respond and say response is not required/ can be covered by a generic response. 
Approval workflows could be automated  
 Delegations have been lifted too high for recruitment and selection 
Procurement process is too long and repetitive  
Reporting on similar things to various areas  Unnecessary reporting - e.g. when staff are in the office and when WFH - needs to be automated reporting of actuals
Make better use of the digital tools we have available
"OO stream employees are unable to access online timesheets - a timesheet is an excel spreadsheet that has to be printed, scanned, signed, submitted, printed, signed, scanned, submitted (if overtime approval required), signed, then submitted to payroll. "
"EMP approval is required for any backfilling of roles, this includes periods leass than 4 weeks in length, the process of EMP approvals, EOIs and recrutiment takes too long and is not worth the effort just to backfill a position for a couple of weeks. This often means that positions sit empty and puts additional pressure on other staff to cover or work is just not done. The selection of sucessful applications for EOIs is not well documented."
The government need to be closer to front of technological advancements and not using old outdated systems (e.g. paper/ excel timesheets). Excel registers for storing client information.
HR delegation to approve special leave for DFV originally sat with a director instead of manager/supervisor therefore creating an confidentially issue. This was reviewed/amended by HR
"Ensuring delegations are aligned/appropriate to function (particuarly HR and financial). E.g. if someone is trusted to supervise staff (even if AO5) they should have delegation that is appropriate to do that aspect of their job. If there is a mismatch, then either the fuction/responsibilies or delegations should be reviewed.  "
certain processes using time consuming processes when better system/technology is available but no one in the team has the technical skills to implement that technology effectively
the team approval processes could be more streamlined using the appropriate technology but no one in the team has the time or knowledge to investigate a better way of doing things 
perhaps using Teams or an alternate system of tracking approvals within the team rather than using emails
my team operates an enquiries inbox which records the responses to each enquiry in an excel spreadsheet which is extremely onerous. we want to transition to a Sharepoint database system but no one in the team has the time or knowledge to implement it.
"Double-handing.  Eg: When a staff member is on-boarded their bank details are provided for payroll.  However, if a staff member travels and they want to claim travel allowance, they are not automatically in the system.  A Vendor Master Data process has to be created.  It's time consuming. To me it doesn't make sense if they are already being paid each fortnight to a bank account.  Couldn't this be aligned?"
"1. Procurement process is overly complicated and convoluted (not straightforward process flow), doesn't cater for business needs (esp. timeframes), insufficient staff resourcing/training.  "
2. Why should Corporate Card processes require hardcopy invoice printout and supervisor approval in addition to approval of online transactions (where copies of the invoices are attached)?
"1. S&T PARIS system is duplicating approvals, adding to workload of work teams for minimal on-the-ground team benefit  "
2. HR approvals process seems to be in a constant state of flux - different rules/processes appear to apply from week to week  
3. Corporate card hardcopy and online approvals just duplication and extra work for no apparent benefit
"Once work unit has approved budget, subsequent downstream approvals of expenditure should be minimised (for example, immediate manager should be able to approve any travel already identified in the budget, not have to go to DDG through MECS)"
"ODG has too many additional review points for MECS and other items.  Following DDG endorsement, it is then reviewed by a junior officer, then often a director and ED before getting to the DG.  This show a lack of trust in the DDGs in divisions and often involves unnecessary tinkering that has to be reviewed by the division."
I selected duplication of approval processes though the examples don't line up with my experience.  I think the recreation of a junior officer approval chain in ODG on top of the divisions seriously slows down approvals and reduces staff time to address requests - particularly urgent ones - by having to factor in extra approval time above DDG level.
unecesary risk aversion - some managers/delegates consider the risk of a client being unhappy with an enforcement decision a reason to not proceed with the decision.
"if an officer makes an enforcement recommendation and the delegate wishes to modify the recommendation or proceed with a different approach, the officer is asked to re-write the recommendation to suit the delegate request. there is no record that the proposed approach is the delegate recommendation, and not that of the professional officer associated with the project. if an officer makes a recommendation and the delegate wishes to do something different, the delegate should be required to record that decision in the assessment documents, and not to bully the professional officer into making a recommendation that may not (in the officers professional opinion) be the most appropriate approach to create an environmental benefit/outcome. "
professional officers authorised to communicate with clients without 3 layers of review on each and every letter.... professional officers supported by the department in those instances where a client may not be happy with the response from a professional officer. 
"compliance inspections by professional officers could result in communication similar to a ""mine record of entry"" as used by the Mine Safety Inspectorate (NRME)."
Streamline. Increase staff's delegated authority to approve documents.  Provide more alternatives in time critical correspondence / projects are du. But approval person is dragging their feet.
"Budget release delays, results in delays to procurement and contract awarding, which results in reduced timeframes to complete works each FY with the impact of fires, wet season as well. Earlier results/reduced red tape would allow better flow of work and the necessary paperwork to commence much earlier"
Readdress financial/HR delegations. Streamline procurement and ensure training is provided to Managers and lower staff
There seems to excessive requirements for filing.  Understandably it is required for auditing purposes. However at present all briefing botes and corro goes to MECs then have to saved in EDocs. It's saved also as a hard copy in filing cabinet once signed approval is received. All this seems excessive. Plus EDOCS is a difficult system to navigate.
What is Mecs for if not also as tracking flow and approvals? I'm ok with using Mecs as an approval process but it should also then be a filing system rather than EDOCS 
Simplify above mentioned process. Use mecs as a filing system for auditing
EMP
"The time, effort and number of people required to make simple decisions is a waste of time and money - let the people with the delegations use them and manage their own budgets. We have a lot of experience and get paid a lot of money to do this job - let us use our skills and knowledge"
Change the delegations (lower for simple things like standard approvals) and actually use the delegations
The new DES procurement process is much more time consuming than before - lots of unecessary paperwork and unclear delegations
"The financial delegations have never been crystal clear to me - perhaps a fact sheet/guide that is easy to understand 'at a glance' would help. It also appears that every division interprets delegations differently. For example, if a Director may have a conflict of interest signing off on something, can't you go to an equivalent Director in a different area - rather than briefing up to the ED (obviously dependent on the approval being sought)? Things like that - if there was better awareness/understanding of what you can and can't do and how to appropriately self-manage risk involved I think this would be a big step forward"
New MECS and PARIS system has definitely helped to streamline red tape/paper forms. So effective software systems definitely have a role to play in reducing red tape. DES procurement's new process has got more red tape than before. Other internal administrative procedures like DDG reporting and the like have been streamlined.   
"Software systems, clearer instruction/training to managers and exec staff about delegations and type of approval required and by whom (e.g. signature on a form, email approval, briefing note etc). "
a lack of clear strategic direction and a means of seeing how broader activities are working in that direction.  If this were clearer it woudl be possible to guide work toward those strategic goals and weight risk more sharply
"Without clear approval to deliver a product in a particular way and/or a and sense that if the guidance (for example strategic goals or legislative processes) is followed an approval is likely, too much time is spent second guessing actions or delaying taking action at all until a specific approval is given at each step. It is the micro stops to check that the guidance and direction remains the same that can disrupt flow and momentum.  Its difficult to quantify loss of momentum or loss of ""timing"" for example if cross workforce action needs to be taken then tight planning is often required and delays can effect the buy in of collaborators and other priorities can overtake the planned works if they are delayed.  We don't seem to have a means to ""measure"" these impacts but suspect that these would represent a productivity gain"
Online timesheets and leave (integrated) have trained us al to stay on top of that paperwork and better organise. 
"Greater investment in knowledge management so guidance is easier to find and confidence that the ""right"" version is in hand.  We use the following:  Sharepoint: policy register; external website: guidance for customers and officers; the intranet: for officers.  Onlyt he external website is easy to seach even where you have a fairly good idea what you are looking for.  Teams offers great opportunitites - but without ecosystem rules about what information goes on what platforms under what circumstances it is very time consuming (and unproductive) to try to find out what rules and process apply and need to be followed.  This is why local knowledge ecosystems are created and maintained so that what local staff need most often is at hand..but the problem remains for information needed only occaisionally at a team or work unit level. "
"Is it possible that it isn't the number or level of approvals that is prompting people to see red-tape as an issue? Could it be that it is the frequency that those check points result in changes to work or decisions?  Many check points don't need to slow productivity unless we are getting stopped at every one or the check is taking too long due to the volume and resources.  It would be good to understand the manifestation of ""red-tape"" in different work areas and business processes to parse out what is needed to fix the productivity impact.  For example of staff feel that it is not possible to get the advice or support they need when they are completing the product, prior to its approval, then an investment in knowledge management might provide greater productivity gains than reducing oversight."
"Procurement processes are now excessive, do not make sense. "
Corporate card approvals needing to be printed out when these are approved online and signed.
" Times sheets have ridiculous system for field staff. Very hard to do week by week, should allow multiple submission/approvals"
Reduce duplication of effort and increase uptake of systems already available to us
No longer need two page response to key selection criteria - but the regions don't know that! 
Recruitment & selection refresher training for panels & senior leaders
"Since the implementation of Connect, processing environmental authority applications and other tasks in Connect has resulted in substantial duplication of effort and loss of time. This has been an ongoing issue for over 24 months. "
Rethink the need to 'automate' complex systems that are better managed by officers. 
Forms should have approval flows. Using the technology available. 
Approval of fortnightly HR reports; 
too many Paris approvals;
 lenghty and slow procurment processes; 
approvals to obtain individuals taxi vouchers; 
approvals for engagement of legal services;
 corporate card approvals and including hardcopy receipts
Simply procurement processes
Complex and slow processes take up time and resources and stop departments from being agile and responsive. 
"Stick to HR and policy delegation as outlined in the policy document, don't create local rules unless it relates to performance improvement plan;  "
Most approvals are tick box exercises inluding timesheets and corporate card approvals. Instead of ticking boxes very frequently it may be better to have default approval and random checks and e.g. machine learning to detect unusual tansactions which can then be audited.
The MECS system and/or email system is ineffective and I have seen approvals processes significantly streamlined in other departments.  Consider consulting with DPC and their use of the TRIM system in particular. 
"The sound implemention of the TRIM system in DPC for corro, Briefing Notes and financial approvals made a marked difference to all these processes. "
TRIM could be used instead of MECS - this would align better with other departments and would have an easier approvals/tracking process. It provides an easier and more secure filing and storage system for confidential documents. A lot of staff are already very familiar with the program if they've worked in other departments. It allows for better use of electronic signatures and approvals (especially during a time when we're working away from office) and has a great search function so you can do your research before beginning a new piece of corro or a brief. 
"We are inefficient with ""touch it twice / multiple times"" occurrences across the department and the multi-approval process reflects a micro-management approach that filters down through the department - there should be more trust in our people to make correct decisions supported by open leadership to establish revised guidelines around this."
"Best practice processes for recruitment and selection would entail a HR database that provides tracking for recruitment processes, candidates, applications, delegate approvals, employee on-boarding and management of talent pipelines for future recruitment processes.  It can also provide employee management for existing employees, allowing compliance and governance of our interactions with our employees to be managed by multiple levels within the department.  "
"Excess reporting particularly over the covid period.  Too much info asked for.  Not a lot used.  A lot of manual re-word and re-submission.  Recruitment has a lot of hoops to jump through.  Unclear rules, a lot of rework. Generally with reporting, too much info asked for. A lot seems not relevant and not well explained.  Manually acquiring information spreadsheets makes it difficult to collected and consolidate accurate information"
Honouring delegations.  I still feel I need to ask for even though I have delegations. O365 should be used more
"Reduce frustration and confusion.  If the requirement for a process can't be changed, we can still look at improving the speed of the process by using the digital tools we have.  If you're relying on word documents and excel spreadsheets it's going to involve a lot of manual steps and will make the process longer than it needs to be"
Use O365 for approvals.  Use O365 to do reporting using SharePoint lists or Forms.  
"single week times sheets that can only be submitted one at a time. Moving to fortnightly reduces demand on my managers, and enabled me to catch up after taking a couple of weeks leave. Alos, i am told my building has an alcohol ban, which is disapointing for a friday clock-off beer with my team."
"Des needs to be a dynamic, efficient organization that has faith in its workers who can encounter and respond to the challenges we face."
"removing red tape requires faith in staff, and a solid acountability process - not just for punishment, but for development and growth."
Clear guidance is requried regarding record keeping.  We should not be required to print and retain hard copies when not a legal contract.
"Over regulated, duplicated and not using electronic systems to their full potential - still using paper"
"Staff need to feel comfortable and supported sometimes the bloker is change, fear and time poor.  If leading from the top similar to how the flexible working arrangements have rolled out, it will provide clear leadership on change and what will be normal practice.  Sometimes conflicting advice is very confusing and is not condusive to implementing change.  "
"Timeframes for approvals for requests from either DLO or Min's office is UNREALISTIC. Getting something at 2.00pm for deadline of 10.00am (next day) to DLO or Min's office is stressful and assumes that everyone in the approval processes (e.g. manager, Director, ED, DDG) are available to sign off on approval immediately. Other examples include lack in visibility in booking (central) meeting rooms but having to find that has access to view and then fill out a form to lodge is a time waster."
MECS is fine as it is - it is just the tight deadlines that needs to be addressed.
"Approval processes are not necessarily the problem (although MECS  is difficult to navigate). It's the tight timeframes that make the approval processes difficult i.e. as mentioned above, getting a request come through at 2.00pm for a 10.00am next day deadlines assumes everyone can drop everything to address the request, approve and assumes the system (MECS) does not have glitches."
"Booking of central seminar rooms at ESP needs to be addressed. I totally support the need to complete a booking form for facilities but the viewing of the calendar for those rooms are only available to admin staff, which makes it very difficult for the project team to be able to plan anything. The steps involved for organising a f2f meeting in a central meeting/seminar room is as follows: 1. Project team decides a workshop is necessary. 2. Project Team has to find an admin person to check if room for relevant date is available/ or suggest dates around the required time. 3. If answer comes back as no, then project team has to change date to accommodate ED or DDG and/or external facilitator. 4. Booking form is lodged. Often there's a lot of back and forth checking between room availability and relevant leadership team's availability before the room is booked. It would be much easier if everyone can view availability/calendar of those seminar rooms like we do for those on our floor so we can pick the most suitable date and lodge a booking room. Just cuts out a few steps and the frustration. "
"procurement over 10K, why have a new system , with no training on how to use which is totally lacking in resoureces, Fire mangment to many stakeholeders and processes blocking what is needed, patrnerships, too much paperwork and blockers for jobs which are commonplace"
"never is a reduction in processes or red tape each time the systems get more complicated with no training provided, but ""we"" are supossed to magically deveolpe these skills and get a hassled when we do something wrong, yet have no training in the first place"
"I've repeatedly escalated concerns about officers acting in Manager Compliance Delegate roles who I believe do not have the appropriate qualifications, personal attributes, experience and knowledge to be effective in the role. More recently there have been examples where decisions have been made at that level that misrepresent the recommendation of the compliance centre and have inaccurately attributed those decisions including providing factually inaccurate information to the DG. I've escalated these concerns internally via appropriate channels repeatedly however the issues remain I believe largely due to senior roles being occupied by non-substantive staff who are unwilling to progress them due to the risk of them missing out on promotions. Compliance centre staff including the those I supervise are continuing to experience long delays in the escalation of enforcement action recommendations due to range of reasons including delays in the allocation process. In relation to information management the introduction of the compliance hub has led to pages and pages of business rules being required to be learnt by staff due to the recommended business requirement specifications not being implemented i.e. SDS reporting measures being built into thes system. As a consequence, much like with Ecotrack, compliance centres are having to maintain additional reporting systems (.xls) so that the requested reports by SMT can be delivered upon. I have many other examples of tasking that would fall under the ""red tape"" category - i welcome the opportunity to provide feedback as i feel that what i escalate daily is watered down to the point that when it is received at a higher level it is effectively meaningless. "
"ilearn - frequently crashes when i'm working on updating PDP reviews, conversations, L&D plans, ilearn support are very helpful but the system is woeful. A significant improvement has been the introduction of the single sign landing page for ESS - it would be good if this could be rolled out to other QG platforms."
I've religously applied the ESR alert rules regarding number of dot points only to have more information added (often inaccurately) as it goes up the hierarchy. Recently one was submitted regarding the unlawful burning of treated timber by a local government - this was amended without engagement with the compliance centre and by the time it go to the DG the key point made was that the council was burning green waste. this was completely inaccurate. concerns were raised and i was directed to amend the alert later on in th enforcement process.
" The confusion around the EMP process of the last year strains credulity. Escalated requests by the compliance centre not escalated at ED level without discussion with teh compliance centre, escalated requests not responded to; advice from the Directorate and ODDG that managers requring urgent HR support have to go through the directorate (when officers in those roles have neither the expereience or expertise to provide the required advice), delays in getting the HR support required to deal with real time, high stress, high risk issues."
"compliance centres are having significant issues enforcing EA's due to the unenforceable nature of many EA conditions, EAs with incorrect lot on plan details, EAs with appendices and maps that are illegible. the current approval process to try and fix these types of scenarios involves trying to convince an MC there is a problem and getting them  to agree to escalate across to their respective Manager Assessment where typically it falls in to a void as a low priority because there are no statutory timeframes attached to the task. This process is one that should be handed back to the compliance centres to resolve with the Manager Compliance (or CDM) given the delegation to approve the EA amendment so that the compliance centre can get on with regulating the activity. "
"The current process, where the remote delegate has no knowledge of matter (site operation, client performance, environmental values, impacted community), is incredibly inefficient as it requires the compliance centre staff to describe, in minute detail, in an assessment report (the template for which is often double digits before any information is added) before they can feel comfortable to make a decision. I was a delegate in my role making assessment and compliance decisions for 6 years before the BMR implemented the current framework. In that time I had one PIN reviewed (and upheld) under the Judicial Review Act. The department employs highly qualified and highly skilled officers in AO7 roles that a more than competent to make these decisions in a timely way because we have the local knowledge of the issues at hand. The current framework has had a deleterious impact on the moral and culture of the staff as it appears that the department does not trust them and is forcing them to gold plate every step of the process. as a consequence staff are reporting in the EOS, as they have done year on year since the implementation of the BMR, that the approval processes are encumbered by red tape - a side effect of this is at staff feel burnt out and overworked. "
ESR Delegations Trial currently in progress.
"integrate ESR Alerts in to the MECS system - amending alerts in emails in clunky, time consuming and difficult. I am frequently unsure if the alert has made it to its intended destination. using MECs would address this issue and make it a more efficient, effective, transparent and accountable process that would better organise the information to faciltate searching of historic matters."
"The above comments are provided as constructive feedback - i have tried my best to do my job in the last 12 years and to be honest i don't recall this role ever being more challenging due to the lack of staff, increase in population in SEQ, apparent increase in clients which we are expected to service with inadequate resources. I have no budget for training, no budget for PPE, little or no budget for environmental sampling. More recently we've been advised, without any prior consultation so far as we can ascertain that a new task for compliance centres is to investigate instances where contaminated land auditors have been identifed as not performing. I find this hard to fathom given that since the introduction of the Regulatory Strategy there has been a systematic reduction in the technical training of compliance staff to the point where my team (and myself) are wholly dependent on the limited capacity of the Technical Support team to respond to our requests for help. I would encourage you, as i've requested in the past, to support the development and implementation of a mentoring program so that compliance officers can increase their technical skills so they can do their jobs (and feel that they are developing as individuals) in a structured and professional framework. "
"DDG EMP approval required for the slightest change to branch personnel, like backfilling employees on leave. This is not just a result of COVID-19, it's a permanent requirement by our DDG. "
"Hard copies of all finance records to be kept as well as electronic. It's 2020, this seems unnecessarily archaic, particularly given that the majority of receipts/invoices are received electronically and even hard copy tax invoices need to be photocopied because the tape print fades over time."
unreasonable time frames - not taking into account busy periods like EOM 
Procurement is often complained about with such a difficult and cumbersome process. Otherwise reporting requirements can at times be excessive.
delegation resting too high within the dept.
because we are finding it a default to risk management everything which leaves delegation too high and leaders with increasingly less time to lead.
Risk managed approach to enable ED's to make call on acceting USL into the estate rather than having it bounce around the divsion getting multiple endorsements prior to arriving at the DDG for their consideration.
Reporting needs to be done strategically and not just machine gunned out with no consideration of who is actually responsibile for knowing how we are tracking on an action plan or emplyment strategy...someone or somewhere should be accountable for all elements of reporting...not just everyone look at everything and risk manage if they respond or not.
"So many different and overlapping standards in the same area and lack of clarity on which is for what; difficult to work out which standard/ guideline/policy should be followed and who should be consulted. Poor indexation & web search confounds further, as does the lack of clean-up (I assume some of these are later guidelines , or 'better' webpages but the older ones (with different names) are not removed so it is impossible to tell."
"Everywhere: over-cautious approach leads to extra steps, multiple people needing to approve or numerous copies kept for minutely different purposes and then confusion and more work to reconcile. Actually causes problems (although may seem to justify the approach)"
"Qucik example - getting reimbursed for the flu jab - the cost to the organisation of approving, registering me on SAP etc etc was huge. My local manager should have had the authority to ok my receipt and reimburse me $20. Job done. Much lower cost to the taxpayer"
"automatic tracking (technology enabled), occasional peer review, and regular manager reviews and audit spot checks can free up the need to get someone senior to approve everything"
"It's about supporting people and regarding it as a learning process, not bashing them over the head if they make a mistake. Rather explaining how and why a better decision could have occurred and how the problem can be remedied. Everyone being scared to make the wrong decision causes analysis/approval paralysis and over working. often a less than perfect decision in a shorter timeframe would be preferable. The risk and return lens needs to be applied to these decision and approval processes."
Process to obtain skin check reimbursement was excessive and not realistic (too many steps to obtain information and doctors don't provide itemised receipts for appointments). Procuring a relatively inexpensive resource for work was excessive. Experiences like this make me less likely to try to find resources in future.
"Many of the systems are very slow by the time information trickles down (i.e MECS requests will be alerted to over email or over the phone before they are issued). Process also involve too many staff (causing staff time, cost wastages and 'too many fingers in the pie') and risks bottlenecks in the system and hinders innovation (real innovation does involve risk)."
Across alot of IT projects there is way too much red tape. Nothing can get off the ground and does not work with agile approaches and innovation
"Having a lack of delegation of some sections of the legislation which means DG approval needs to be sought for something that could be handled at a regional level. Creating additional regional policies that sit on top of existing directives. Rolling up delegations when new positions are introduced, so that something that used to be signed by one level goes up to a higher level."
I've spent a lot of time working in permitting and regulation with various Qld government organisations and QPWS seems to be behind and not as advanced in systems/processes.
Having better templates/processes available so that these can be utilisied in stead of local work arounds being produced.
New procurement process. incorrect instructions and templates. need to duplicate unique id info on each of the templates.
"forms need to be able to be auto signed instead of printing, scanning and resending for endorsement."
No the approval process rather the templates and forms which are required to be completed.
"Auto fill headers and footers on the procurement portal, have all instructions correct, put every day examples ion the instructions rather that ""mother-hood "" statements which do not mean a thing to the people writing the proposals, change the flow in the portal to reflect the steps necessary to complete the task - dont have a template in there which is not needed for the process."
"32 pages of paper work to purchase a side x side vehicle, RFQ and contract details confused all of the suppliers. One supplier who does procurment for Defense said he had never experienced anything like that to quote on a vehicle worth under $20 000"
Wasting to much time for operational rangers to undertake simple procurement tasks
"EPP HR require very detailed selection reports, even for short, temporary positions.  "
"REporting for grants is duplicated across multiple spreadsheets required by multiple parties, reporting requirements are not clear."
Trust that staff know what is and isn't appropriate in a social media post. We get paid well to do our jobs and yet we're not trusted to do them.
HR Delegations are overridden by departmental processes (e.g. EMP) suggesting a lack of trust in ED's and DDG's to manage their business within the guildelines; 
"Having worked in multiple divisions, DES has local business rules in each division which are often very different - given these processes are department wide a unified approach would allow a consistent outcome (e.g. asset management is totally up to the business area/division as to how they would like to manage (or not)); there are many more examples which can be provided in areas of finance, admin  and reporting."
Place trust back to the ED's to manage their business rather than pushing approvals further up the line to DDGs and to other committees
Genuinely question the business process and challenge the status quo - i.e. is each step necessary and adding value? Just because this is how it has been done in the past does not mean this is the best way. 
"DES and ESR level delegations. Lack of operating discipline and conformance to Delegation authority, if you're delgated a level of responsibility then trust people to execute and not add additional approval requirements (i.e. Finance). "
"Also a tendency to require a feedback loop with Stakholders that is death by consultation, need to move to a consult, decide inform model with support from senior managment to back the approach.  "
cease duplication of tracking (eg RTIs); cease alerting or reporting normal business or posiible business; work on existing systems and their reporting functions to extract reporting; look at the literature on building trust in agencies and determine if that literature leads us to systems that build truust that teams can do their jobs properly
"Trust the staff! Writing a paper for external publication can be difficult, but shouldn't need to be checked and re-checked by various levels of senior management."
"There needs to be greater trust of managers todo their job without approvals having to be constantly deelgated to excessively high levels, for example media requests.  Managers should be able to decide if it is appriate for there staff to deal with minor media requests (local newspapers good news stories).  "
At the moment we have directors having to give permission for work related overnight travel.  For goodness sake trust your managers to know if overnight travel is required by there staff or not.   
"The cumbersome and time consuming approval processes are indicative of a senior bureaucracy that has little or know trust in their staff.  This lack of trust is disheartening and demoralising to those staff.  I want our senior management to be dealing with the big ticket, strategic tasks (as I am sure they would prefer to be doing) like getting us more resources not having to sign off on whether we can talk to the local newspaper about what we are doing to save endangered species or if an overnight trip is necessary  to do our job. "
 Remote area forms have to be signed off at senior level for approval these staff often (not always) have very little experience of working in remote environments.      
"Once again i think a lot of the ""red tape"" is indicative of a lack of trust on the part of senior management to trust there staff to do the right thing.  We have a management culture that micro managers to an unnecessary level.  "
trusting staff
"Trust and empower your senior officers/management to make decisions. Likewise, senior officers/management must take ownership of their decisions. "
Business and getting things done is WAY too slow. Not every step of the organisation and hierarchy need to approve at each stage. It elongates timeframes unnecessarily. Especially in an agency that is so Top Heavy there can be multiple layers of approvals needed for the simplest of processes. We need to build trust and accountability and efficiency. Not everyone has to see everything just because they are in the hierachy
More trust need to be put in place for those who are delegated to make decisions (e.g. A08s).
"Corporate Card monthly statements. Should be done electronically, no need to print and collect, since Promaster is digital system. don't understand the need to print and waste time. Also, expenses are already approved by supervisor and all is documented in first place."
"Staff card access: My card expired and I had to get into an email chain with 4 parties (myself, supervisor, admin and security) in order to get a simple request done (get my access to building back). "
"Other HR - Travel approvals - ALL travel requires Director approval, even when it is part of daily and team standard operations. Often accommodation needs to be booked last minute to accommodate weather and staff availability, so waiting for Director approval prior to even booking accommodation can cause delays and uncertainty in team plans."
A recent social media post went through more than 5 people to approve a post that most people would have viewed for less than 3 seconds
"If this is a genuine activity then perhaps consider who is best to lead e.g. if it is a HR function then they would NOT lead to ensure unbiased approach, similarly if it is a finance or reporting function"
"EMP processes & approvals are cumbersome, require excessive work, planning and time frames to complete."
Many approval tasks seem to require excessively high delegation levels compared with others. It bogs management down.
Streamline EMP process. Let managers manage instead of writing essays to justify employment of staff. 
Lack of coordination between group for overlapping projects that creates excessive administration and meetings (eg Bushfire recovery project across different divisions: communication between divisions was initially poor and required time and energy to focus).  DES units don't cross engage well enough and corporate support operates without full understanding of requirements of other divisions.  There's too many independant executive groups.
Procurement process has recently undergone change that has created a more complex process with higher approval delegations.  Its the single biggest risk to capital works and maintenance program delivery due to extended timeframes.  The new process has placed a considerable strain on regional resources and on procurement team ability to support procurement.

New QPWS permitting system coming online.  Permits were previously managed via spreadsheet by regions and centric units.  The new system will track permit progression and delegates approve through the same system.
"Systems that are better integrated and compliment each other (assets systems, SAP, financial reporter etc) with better flow through of process and delegates."
"Additional apprvoal requirements in conflict with formal delegation authority (ie finace delegation give approval to purchase but it is then routed through admin to get ""permsission"" to acutally buy/execute. Additional division level delegations differing from DES level document.    "
"Duplicative and undermines authority provided to position. We should empower people and then get out of their way. If they make mistakes, hold them accountable."
Remove all but DES level Delgations for Hr and FInance.  Mandate no additional approval steps. If the delegations are incorrect or at the wrong level they should changed and stuck to. 
Excessive time spent on following up approval processes/approvers - needs to be streamlined.
performance reporting
excessive duplication of documentation. 
Approval level for certain permits is sent high due to previous practice when may indeed fall at level level based on delegation/legislation sin off
"allow lower level delgation in low risk assessment processes, when permitted by legislation"
Recognition of low risk and operational works versus high risk approval process requirements
DES policy approval process seems very elongated and makes policies out of date before publication
Travel
"Field work is a requirement in this group - SL, Dir, ED and DDG approval is too much.  Let the groups do their business.  COVID reporting is also excessive."
Travel and HR
When underresourced this red tape makes it very difficult to get the work done properly.
"New Procurement Portal makes procurement process more onerous than the previous approach, there is little transparency on next steps until just before you start them so little chance to get any momentum. Procurement staff are doing their best but the system lets them down."
Procurement Portal
"would be helpful to revisit and refresh common understanding of delegations and what they mean - e.g. in procurement, who approves a procurement exercise, who signs the contracts and requisitions, etc. so there is no confusion on who to brief and how high to go."
The process to go through all these approvals takes excessive time and leads to stress due to impending deadlines
development approvals and registration certificates being combined to make an environmental authority
"pest management plans, they get approved by relevant staff then up the ladder only to get held up and pretty much rewritten by manager which has never happened before. this tends to hold staff up on being able to do pest plan work"
"Procurement portal requires us to enter the same information multiple times. Recent expenditure reporting on awarded contract - if the Dept wanted, all the information could be derived from the procurement portal. Excessive approvals and unneeded red tape waste a lot of valuable time. "
In-house legal request forms require ED approval - surely manager approval can suffice?
"It would save time and create less stress / headache. We also won't have to continually explain / apologise to external stakeholders about the delays from our internal processes - they act fast, so should we."
"extensions of HD needing to go to ODDG for approval is un necessary and leads to last minute planning. the current delegations for say an extension of HD thats been though EMP and merit process, we ahve the Buget and its within the FTE cap needs to go to ODDG for approval when the delegation is AO8. causing significant dificulties at local level with these dscisions only being made up to a week from end date.   "
us the existing formal delegations instead of introduced business process lifting (unofficially) the delegatiosn form AO8 to DDG/ODDG
"As above, where current delegations exist for decision making (HD extensions for example) there are numerious exixting processes in place to protect buget etc. for example we have FTE cap, buget and EMP process and existing rules around appointments, this makes lifting the decision to DDG or ODD for say an extension of 3 months totally unnecessary and leads to problems where the decision is only made a week from end date and the substantive business unit are unable to back fill in time etc. not to mention the instability it creates for both teams and the person. is this best use of ODDG time when the other numerous controls are in place I wonder."
The current Procurement process is synonymous with red tape to me
"The 'new' procurement process is excessively burdened by paperwork, back and forth with procurement officers and the new portal seems to only duplicate the entire process. The entire process must be completed for anything over 10K (inclusive of GST) which is laughable and wastes and extraordinary amount of time for something that is identified as low risk. "
"Because the procurement process as it stands is inefficient, complicated, requires many resources (multiple staff) to complete and takes too long. Especially for something that is low cost/low risk. "
"Raise the threshold for purchases that require procurement officer involvement, reduce the number of forms required to complete the process. Get rid of the portal."
It feels like whoever created the procurement portal / process did zero user experience testing. Any future changes should seek actual user/client feedback before release. 
Approval for field work
Requiring multiple levels of approval from different people to conduct necessary field work.  This was never required 10 years ago.  Even before Covid occurred it was unnessarily complicated.  This should be rolled back as covid is getting under control in QLD.
"In this day and age manual forms should not be used.  If you need to print a form to fill it in and then scan it to send it via email, then the system is outdated.  The original data should be entered into a form that can be used by a system automatically to apply any approvals required. We should be harnessing online flows and automated processes.  Co-vid has pushed this along, but there is still a long way to go."
The online flows in O365 for capital procurement is definately an improvement over what was in place before.
Removal of manual forms.  All forms should be able to be filled in online and signed digitally.
The new procurement process was meant to make things easier but it's harder as there's more forms and you still have to get everyone's signature then upload it all. Should all be digitised with work flow approvals. Has just made old process longer.
Streamline approvals rather than the old print and sign (though this has improved slightly due to COVID and people are now signing some things electronically)
"Need a system where you can easily submit forms for approval - e.g. SAP where you complete a form and submit for approval, approver gets an email and clicks a link to approve and it keeps moving as electronic signatures on pdfs still take time."
Procurement processes have improved immensely with a much greater level of support
Too much time is wasted waiting for approvals.
Forms that dont match the approval you are requesting.  Forms that are designed for one senario
"A lot of the ITP forms now require director aproval, plus you haev to submit each one seperately x 40"
Many ITP forms
Wastes everyone's time. Does not need directors approval. Forms are not suitable for what you are requesting
"When changing flexible work arrangements or working from home there are often multiple forms but there is no central place to find them all, so there is a search cost. There are local admin forms for these in our division as well as those in Aurion."
At the end of 2019 our division removed the need to fill out a local part time work agreement that duplicated the one in Aurion
There was a red tape reduction process and survey a few years ago so it might be worth looking if everything was implemented from that
EMP and FTE issues
Fianance reporting
sharepoint
allow managers to manage
QPWS&P HR often gives very different advice than corporate HR - which is frustrating as it seems that QPWS&P HR is a blocker in many instances
"Quite often, the timeframes that responses are requested in are absolutely ridiculous. It's almost that quantity is valued over quality - this has huge risk in some cases."
"Create a central system or database where information on all major projects is captured and used often, rather than the same request coming at us from different people for the same information all the time. "
"QPWS&P HR needs to be required to align with corporate HR processes. Making up local processes when corporate processes and direction is provided, is ridiculous, time-wasting and frustrating."
Changing processes in recruitment
" electronic and paper copies to be signed off for corporate cards,"
duplication in timekeeping systems
"Aurion is not a whole system, there is no way we can track TOIL or ATL easy as supervisors. "
Having to submit and approve electronic corporate cards and also submit and approve paper copies is unnecessary
"There is a lot of double handling, it can stall situations where immediate action needs to be taken, it can take away time from other tasks"
"With travel bookings and travel allowance claims we used to have to fill out the form, print it, get it physcially signed by a manager, ans then scan and save it to a folder. Now we fill out the form but get a 'signature' over email and capture this by saving the email to the bookings and claims folders."
Stepping away from paper based approvals 
"There isn't enough time to complete the field work required within the National Parks, State Forests etc. Being required to then also complete paperwork that is clunky, unstreamlined and triple handled is a waste to of time. Simplyfy, centralise and streamline the processs and have administration staff do the administration work rather than tying up field staff."
"For time sheets and leave applications, automate the whole process rather than needing to print paper out each time. Approvals for travel and overtime could also be included so that when timesheets, Travel claims etc are filled out we don't need to constantly try and attch and store approvals."
"Operational staff should be doing operational jobs, not both operational and excissive administration tasks that are better off being handled by admin staff."
"If you look at current establishment of QPWS for approvals- ED, RD, PR, A/PR, SR Tech Stream than you get to an SR of a Management Unit. Operationally inefficient"
"Pest - Referall Team, Fire - Referral Team, HR - Back to RD(Recruitment), Travel - Back to PR"
"Due to wasted time in duplication. There is less rangers and very fey admin staff. More time filling out paperwork and not embracing technology. ipads, electronic processes. Less signing and scanning. "
"Doing timesheets, leave forms, asset capture and reporting via tablets and not having to enter the office!"
I worked in NZ for several months as a QPWS ranger. Their systems are very streamlined and flow well. We are not far out of the fax world! 
my.appointments online form - long and confusing/constant requests for information on contentious issues every second day -related to a minister travelling/procurment levels with downgraded signoff and responsibilities they have been trained to execute- mandated and controlled by DES procurement - who are also way too slow to help groups with purchasing/way too many corporate requests - even via other depts ministers travelling to areas in QLD/to many over-detailed finance requests- constant inspection of small overspends and underspends/contant comments that funding will be removed if not spent even when reasons are given/signing of weekly corporate HR reports is overkill and not needed/setting up vendors and having to ring them to confirm details they have already supplied is embarrasing and demeaning and not required - too many checks/the pushback of work by QSS to the groups and you are powerless to stop it - even though we pay QSS to work for us./
Level 1 and 2 procurement need to go back to the approval levels they had - mainly to approve low level low risk purchase- eg Level 1 used to have -up to 100K on SOA - DES procurement have taken some of the delegations away and so they are so busy sometimes requests dont get answered for a week - not good enough/ MECS recently had to be used for the ED to sign off on a $110 online conference - overkill and could have been approved by a lower level officer.
too many layers added over original delegation levels.  some online forms long  some online forms confusing and not intuitive  STILL a paper and electronic system going - eg scientist fills out a paper travel expense - then the admin enters it all electronically then another higher admin. staff member approves it on SAP  (after the paper copy has been signed)  Staff and companies removed from SAP after a short period of time - adding more work to re-add later.
There needs to be a serious task force to look at this - and it needs to be an admin task force from staff in the groups - the requests for information and overgovernence have increased exponentially.  
improve or replace Connect system
There are different ways of paying invoices which are confusing and are difficult to track and monitor
having to provide the same information for a large number of reports. 
"BCP procurement new process not simple process got more complex without additional assistance with procurement officiers over 10,000 dollars process, need SOA suppliers to make the process easier to the rangers/ staff at the gound level, Maintenance / Capital budget takes too long to be handed down each with too many rules and processing required, Loc8 does not seem to be user friendly need to more simple system. "
The system needs fixing. Needs a team of experts to handle the complex processess so that we can get back on the ground where the real action happens. The public do not see the internal processses they see the action on the ground. we just need to make the systems user friendly and simple and employ more staff to tackle the complex systems we have.
Manager has delegation but still have to go higher for approval. 
Paperwork to engage consultants is complex and time consuming.
Too much time is wasted on red tape and navigating processes/approvals.
"Too much energy focus on process, and not enough focus on outcomes.  The process might work but what if the outcome is a fail?"
"It's frustrating to have the funds to do something, it's approved by governance and in a strategy but can't appoint anyone to do it. Red tape stopping us doing our work."
"It takes weeks for approval of an EOI and time ran out to appoint anyone, so the work is not done"
"To ensure money and time isn't wasted in appointing resources   To meet milestones and objectives of projects  To close loopholes in legislation - development is being approved through assessment processes, but no one is checking on whether the desired outcome is being achieved because there's not enough MERI happening"
"Compliance, involving recording of patrol records (local), issuing of ticket or warning, recording on CIMS as well as forwarding copies to local and central offices where the details are recorded on a system again by other staff."
a number of times approvals are rejected or blocked at levels and not progressed even though projects would pass when assessed at higher levels. Parallel processes simply waste time.
"Online form systems that can be edited and that allow atatchments to be automatically added and stored to the original document, so mulitple copies are not generated or required."
Procurement processes - confusing and many forms asking for same information &
more and more IT systems - MECS etc - getting confusing and also time consuming especially as not talk to earh other - can we have one simple dashboard?
Opportunity for systems to talk to each other at the same time. Help reduce duplication and also help the user to be less confused by the number of steps and what is required next/when.  A simple understandable and INTUITIVE dashboard with all that is required would be good.
DG decided that he didn't want BN's just for information.
"Simple, intutive intergrated dashbaord - has MECS, Procurment, Legal, Finance etc  "
"No clear PURPOSE for particular steps existing. There may be good reason, but it's not transparent to the end user."
"E.g.: a media response is required by Friday. So ED wants to review by Thursday. So Dir wants to review it by Wednesday. So Manager wants to review it by Tuesday. So person now only has 1 day to write it, and then endure 4 rounds of back-and-forth. This is soul-crushing and, over time, invalidates self confidence. This type of behaviour is rampant through local business areas, and probably not transparent at senior levels. In isolation it seems trivial, but when this is the repeated type of experience across many different things, it can feel suffocating."
"I believe making red tape auditable and widely visible (through improved systems and automated workflows) will make people think twice about it. It would highlight where these bottleneck people exist, and we can then address how to mitigate that issue. At present, the fact that most of the redtape feels like it is invisible (hidden within local processes) makes it feel unsolvable."
"Certain people feel 'entitled' to gatekeep processes at an extremely granular level, so they retain local control. This is probably helpful in certain contexts, but as a general practice in our day-to-day jobs feels wholly demeaning."
recruitment processes particularly during and post COVID; HR temp to perm processes too much falls back on the EDs. lots more I can't think of right now.
demands from corporate finance - no context or background and little info plus tight time frames; 
over the top approval processes for small changes to policies; 
too time consuming under current processes. Delegations assume all levels in each branch/business unit - where there is no SO role the AO8 does  not have delegations and it all falls to the ED. very time consuming and not always necessary.
Business continuity/Disaster recovery plans - worthless garbage that nobody would read in the event of a technical outage
"If you work in an environment where your leaders are competent and responsive, approvals can be obtained efficiently. If not, you spend ages explaining the details to your incompetent leader and then they dither for ages because they don't want to commit to anything."
"Employ competent leaders that are focussed on getting a quality job done in an timely and ethical manner, as opposed to the current practice of promoting incompetent bureaucratic sycophants."
Excessive documentation requried for performance management;  
multiple layers of asset oversight;
"lack of clarity/mixed approvals for different communication channel publishing (Internet, Intranet, Sharepoint, DG newsletter, CS Newsletter);"
"not sure if the high number of DG and CS newsletters can be interpretted as red tape, but the messages are diluted as I can't keep up (add to that the spread of local area Teams pages)"
"Senior positions are having to defer their responsibilities given this existing layering, when role descriptions and their accepted level of seniority authorise an increase in decision making responsibilities."
Simplified recruitment approvals
Delegate financial approvals to lower level positions. .
Reduce the amount of newsletters being produced
Reduce the use of different commnication channels. 
"So many great improvements over the last couple of years since the change of DDG CS, some more positive change to reduce paperwork and layering would make our jobs less obstructive and more enjoyable."
"Digital Procurement Framework,"
" Asset Disposal Process advice, Stocktake Process"
The new 'Covid normal' requires many of our process to be automated or put into a digital space as many staff are now working from home or only work in an office sporadically. An example is the process for submission and approval of Ranger timesheets. This situation also applies to delegation approvals.
Admin officers Aurion timesheet submission and approvals.
Significant review of the Digital Procurement Framework and allow feedback from staff who have procurement experience.
Micromanagement of HR
Micromanagement of porcurement. Restrictions mean unable to spend budget to progress projects.
Recruitment and contractor restrictions. Have budget but can't spend it.
multiple approvals for the same process eg. HR and finance and management
It is stopping operational units doing their jobs and progressing projects. Fixation on major projects ignores the dozens of other important projects and programs ongoing across the department.
Overlapping and conflicting directives and policies
Over delegation
"Lack of clarity around who is authorised to approve what and allowing multiple approval options for all/most processes such as digital signatures, email approval and physical signature and some ITP processes."
Go Card registers
"Prior to COVID not many people used digital signatures, now there are multiple ways to sign a document, all equally valid."
I suggested using a SharePoint list as a Go Card register but was told that we had to have a piece of paper with a physical signature. In most cases I could not read the signature and therefore did not know who had the card.
Reduce the number of steps required
"MECS is an extremely unnecessarily complex and ineffective system. There are so many departmental templates that achieve nothing, are ugly, and make things difficult for no gain, or at least no gain that’s been communicated. Documents communicate better when they are attractive, restrictions on templates make that impossible. It’s too difficult to find information on the intranet as the search function is pretty crummy. "
Document templates and restrictive policies around their use. 
Trying to put information in an effective way for good communication in the templates provided is near impossible 
"Use of online programs for work tracking. The system we use in science is pretty archaic and difficult to use. There are plenty of online trackers that are much easier to use, easier to read, look nicer and are probably, in truth, cheaper. "
Field Trip
Short weekly field trip to Samford requires individual applications
"PERM & long-term TEMP recruitment processes (initiating, undertaking and gaining ""approval"") are required to progress through various levels of review to get to an outcome whch results in a long time to comlete (generaly 2-3 months). With the general notice period being 2 weeks for an outgoing staff member, this regularly leave gaps in teams for extended periods."
HR delegations
To streamline process and minimise unnecessary paper and email traffic. Email fatigue is a real issue resulting from this.
"HR delegations could benefit from moving to the same approach as Financial delegations. Suitability of HR delegations would benefit from understanding the work environment and workforce that a position is responsible for. Eg, a Regional Director has a significantly larger workforce that they oversee as opposed to a Director of a Corporate team. Allowing a Regional Director more ability to exercise HR delegation (aproving PERM recruitment outcomes for example), would greaty assist with resolving resourcing issues (gaps) on the ground."
"I appreciate the current (and ongoing) challenges with budget reductions (savings) and FTE caps. However, some minor changes to delegations to assist with creating more efficiencies and alleviating fatigue being felt across the workforce."
Duplication of manual and system level processes for corporate card
duplicated processes
delegations not effectively used.
"publishing approval for reports, articles, factsheets, etc - now use a risk based approach"
"For corporate card approvals, use the system to generate end of financial year documentation"
"simpler tools to use office365 to progress approvals, to replace emails. "
Not enough staff on the ground to handle the admin side of day to day processess
Asset disposal and register too complex
"I think procurement is getting easier, but coming off a low base"
"EMP approvals, "
"approval to issue compliance actions, approval to backfill, approval to travel, "
"an enormous amount of effort goes into briefing, duplicate briefing, follow up briefing, approvals for most things we do"
"Minor procurement maximum $ limit should be increased from $10,000 to $50,000 to decrease the number of times we have to go through the lengthy procurment process as it currenlty stands"
to streamline process and create time efficiencies for staff
"The same level of detail is required for $10K projects and $100K projects, also the same level of approval is required for routine and non-routine field work."
"significant delays in decision making for simple, non-contentious approvals + inequitable employment processes"
Publication of reports processes are so slow that the data are often out of date even before they get approved to be posted (and they're non-contentious)
Hard copy printouts of credit card receipts is duplication of the online database 
Wastes time for well paid employees that could be delivering more for the people of Queensland instead of wasting time and money on arduous internal reporting
lose email and only use online chat platforms so engagement can happen immediately and not get lost in the swathe of emails bouncing back and forth with sometimes substantial delays
duplication of reporting 
"Corporate card - approvals via email, then signing of hard copy receipts, then approval through online system.  Duplication and time wasting. "
travel approval processes; delegations don't always seem to be enabled - higher levels of approval sought; too many forms; recent examples where an online process has reverted to a manual form process. 
"Many processes need to be automated - to reduce email approvals, paper approvals, then scanning and putting in to MECS and then having to track the approval, associated record keeping etc.  Too many steps and too much manual handling.  The proliferation of the multiple ways that people now wish to organise things through the different digital systems available to us is also an issue - it is a job in itself to check on all of the systems and stay on top of the communication and requests. "
Recruitment/selection is getting easier. 
The recent experience of everybody working from home due to COVID and the introduction of digital approvals and signatures has been very positive. Some of these processes need to stay. 
"An example was a recent conversion of a base grade ranger from temp to permanent.  The ranger had merit listed on an open merit process but we still had to go through a drawn out process to assess if the person had met requirements to convert from temp to permanent as they had been employed for two years continuously in a temp role.  When advised that the person was merit listed and suitable for a vacancy anyway, we were advised that we still had to complete the conversion paperwork.  The end result was that it was not supported to convert the employee because a small part of their continuous employment had been in a level higher than base grade and therefore it did not meet criteria (this is ridiculous as the person had demonstrated ability at a higher level and surely we would want to encourage this and employ the person).  As a result and approximately 6 weeks later, the person was appointed using the merit list.  Something that had been advised earlier and ignored due to inflexibility in process and creating unnecessary delay and work."
Because it is limiting the ability for staff to get work done and completely swamping directors and higher with work that should be delegated down.
MECS items going through 16 sets of hands
" compliance alerting, updated compliance alerting,"
 ITP procurement
"duplicated leave calendars, duplicated registers of pretty much everything"
travel approvals
"Automation of travel forms, "
"Flexible work arrangement approvals (not for me, but i have wittenssed it), and SARAs applications (historically). It always seems odd to me that a position is delegated to make a decision regarding certain matters (eg: A08, or Director), but they have to excalate to the ED, who then has to seek permission from the DDG. "
" DDG approval in certain matters, when lower positions are delegated, appears inefficient. "
"its the application of the exisitng framework/s which i think frustrates people. Access to the various policies and procedures are readily available, so we expect they will be adhered to. However, in some circumstances they arent. I expect this is what frustrates people the most. "
I think the implementation of the processes needs to be audited first. 
"Impliment an auditing program to ensure the procedures are being followed 100%. Where they aren't, determine why not, and amend the policy/s accordingly. "
Complex pest management drafts
Reviewing pest management plans multiple times with excessive information presented
Clearer timeframes for Regional Director response expected back
 Rangers should be on TimeKeeper Aurion timesheeting
Multiple instances of staff having to duplicate or review documents multiple times due to overcomplicated or unclear processes and stringent terminology required by RD. Staff are adapting but the approval process is becoming a blockage to on ground work and is not most efficient use of time.
Some good automation in the finance space (eg. GPEVs)
Rangers onto TimeKeeper timesheets with ingrained rules to simplify
"Unnecessary checks and approval points, inefficient use of time and resources"
Management too scared to make a decision
Field work approvals
Peer-reviewed publication; field work.
"For publication, the internal review process is, in my experience, thorough enough. But then the manuscript has to sit with two or three levels of senior management for months, waiting on each of them to read it. When the manuscript finally comes back, there's only minor edits. It's a complete waste of time, and actually a disincentive to publish. If I could change one thing about my workplace it would be this ridiculous process.    In regard to field work, it isn't worth doing these days, such is the paperwork required."
"app based vehicle log books, "
reasonable practices for supervisors to manage Long term HR issues. The list is endless.
Allow middle management to sign off on more for their staff.  For example field trip paperwork.  Reduce the amount of forms that need to be completed the share quantity of forms that must be filled out is mind boggling.  For example I fill out a trip request form that has details of where when who will be my contacts how I will be contacted etc etc.  Then I fill out the same stuff on a remote area travel form. 
Legal services needing to be signed off by an ED (too high a delegation).   
Fortnightly HR reports are sent around and I cannot understand how reviewing them contributes to better management.
Automation of approval flows sounds good but you need to be able to get ready assistance when you need it.  This doesn't seem to be the case with the procurement system.  
Not really but I would suggest that the fortnightly workforce report can just be dumped.  Surely there is a way that QSS could identify outliers among HR data and recommend an agency investigate? 
Procurement processes and forms do not align and do not make sense without significant human interaction to understand the form. Local arrangements do not help
"Too much time is spent trying to understand the process, and too little information is provided with some forms of approvals"
Procurement processes are very time consuming for staff.
"No local delegations, just one set applied across a division"
confusing and detailed forms required
Because it is confusing and time consuming to work through and try to understand. It encourages staff to avoid doing some important aspects of their work. 
"please keep policies up to date - for example travel restrictions due to COVID are hampering field work, but are no longer necessary, based on Qld Health guidelines."
"alot / most depends on the risk adversity or knowledge of the ""approvers"""
There seems to be an unnecessary level of bureaucracy at the branch level that duplicates existing divisional/departmental processes.
Working from home is now much simpler.
A simple red tape reduction reporting system might be useful - enable staff to flag where red tape is generating inefficiency or impeding service delivery.

too much change to IT systems intended to reduce staffing and for record keeping.  when used infrequently you can never navigate through the system - for example claiming an employee expense eGPV or TA claim on fraedom.  increasinly proffesional staff are picking up more administration tasks daily rather than undertaking core duties 
"changes of legislation, governance of low risks activities (authorities), complying with all facets of the legislation associated with assessing applications for various authorities"
provide more administration support for protected area manager professionals to reduce the administration burden of picking up more tasks as IT systems replace persons.   
It adds delays to getting a decision enacted.
"travel for workshops, conferences, fieldwork, publishing papers "
Allow middle management to sign off on more for their staff.  For example media permissions
multi layers of internal review and approvals for publishing papers
publishing papers; travel
"not a clear process, too much to wade through"
reduce levels of approval and reduce level of approval to line manager
"Authorising use of science based data, websites and systems for scientists.  The process to get approval is lengthy, has too many decision makers in the chain, and slows down researchers who need to move at a faster pace. "
"Staff frustration is high, and they end up bypassing internal systems and doing work on public cloud or home systems just to avoid unnecessary restrictions. "
"To get my vendor number, which was needed to submit a skin check claim, took 30 steps, numerous emails, multiple staff contacts and nobody seemed to understand the process."
Design systems for the user not the administrator.
Approvals for getting contractor resources on board; weekly reporting; unable to access IT procurement resources.
"Often if people aren't sure on the approval process, the default is then for highest-level approval, which slows things down."
Provide suitable IT procurement resources. 
"For whole-of-division reporting/ admin, allow the central point to contact the business group admins directly."
 Improve HR SharePoints.
"Nearly all databases can export a file in the correct format to go into SAP.  Provided there are approved internal approvals, why can we not simply upload into SAP without having to go through the GPRV system.  The same piece of data is entered up to 3 times in some form or another but it is already digital."
Forms have approver's names with protected electronic signatures. Why is there a requirement for the person who digitally signs the document to also meail that they approve. It is redundant.
Repetition of data entry when the data is already digital.  Double/triple handling.
The introduction of the mass GPRV however there is still a manual component that can be improved on.
approvals of procurement where there are safety measures in place (digital signatures of financial delegates).  More intergration (couple with approved internal security processes) to speed up data going into SAP
"Procurement processes are very heavy in this department comoared to other orgs, and lack of procurement officers to cope"
"Many overly burdensome minor reporting requirements for lower priority business, new routine timesheets / leave audit for example  "
"in addition to already stated, review all forms or apporval processes to allow digital signature / approvals"
"Immense inefficiencies and double handling, overly burdensome procurement practices that don't actually add to accountability measures or getting value for money"
"lift lower level finace deleagtion for routine procurement where value for money can still be demonstrated i.e. under $30,000 and basic. Look at HPW and TMR procurement and SOA practices. "
Procurement is the biggest example and has the most impact on our business delivery. Every review over the last ten years to fix that has added just more layers of process. This prevents us from meeting departmental expectaions and progarm delivery as well as a knoiwck on to other work and programs that do not have a procurement aspect to them due to time loss. Capacity is limited in procurement support
Procurement is a nightmare. 
Unnecessary high level approvals
"In DES sciences the scientists need to undertake project approvals and pre-approvals and contract management themselves (other agencies have a dedicated unit to assist with this).  Therefore our time is really restricted, particularly if you are a proactive scientist that gets a lot of projects."
More admin assistance
Excessive number and length of documents that needed to be created to achieve a procuremnt. I think teh page count was getting up towards 100 - ridiculous. Coupled with a clunky online system.
More thought needs to be given to a reasonabel procurement approcah that doesn't suck up days and days of work for the sake of arse-covering
Also all the approvals and steps required for project approval (Paris)
Unreasonable time demands not commensurate with the risks
Work related travel approval
Review of delegations
Recruitment and Selection and the new conversion process
Too many levels of approval
Approvals are overly complicated and require to many sections to be involved.  Irrelevant questions slow down the process.  Divisions should have some autonomy 
Allow divisions to manage
To avoid unnecessary duplication of information throughout the process
Requires too much time from scientific staff for administration tasks.
Division EMP requirments - always having HR decisions days before the persons contract/ higher duties is due to end. 
"Officer's/people should be given the decency of knowing where they are going at the end of their higher duties/contract and knowing if they will be continuing in the position. It is unacceptable that people keep having to wait until the last minute/week to find out what is happening as it is mentally exhausting - eg, do I have a job? do I make that decision as I wont be in the role next week? "
Bot Q&A via a form
 data entered once-only
"AI and process technoogy exists to resolve these issues, saving time"
"Bots, Azure forms"
"Unnecessary process steps and duplication and doing so beacuse it is how we have always done things. Where there is a perception of 'too much red tape' we need to review the end to end process and ask the questions of why and if necessary design a whole new process to be efficient, cost effective and satisfying to worj with"
Improvemnets in Procurement Processes
"Six Sigma, Lean processes .... there are multiple methods and tools. The bigger hurdle is getting buy-in and building on KPIs and accountability to meet timeframes and this will lead to less red tape and better ways of working"
Waste of time & uses limited resources
Because there are insufficient resources to perform the work required.
"I have ideas but these are not invited or considered, there is no consultation prior to decisions being made and the resultant impacts on processes and workload."
"Having to add additional steps to my day to make sure that reports run for Managers is correct, where I am required to duplicate information in several places, for the sake of management. It is inefficient and tiresome."
"Sometimes I have to update Dynamics on a daily basis, to duplicate information in several places, so that the reports collect the right information. However, the way the reports are run changes frequently so several times a week we are amending how we record information into Dynamics, often changing what has already been done because someone has decided we need to do something differently. There is little reprieve on the situation. When I raised my concerns with my manger, I receive no understanding or empathy on the stress it can create."
"I generally find the approval process is okay, but it is the recording of information, having to make changes almost daily to the system (Compliance Hub - Dynamics), is ridiculous."
"Red tape used to exist in Compliance with Connect, but then we did not use Connect. Now, we use Dynamics but again the red tape has started again. It is draining and demotivating."
"Reporting should only be done in Dynamics once the data is correct and it can then make decisions. However, until such time that we know what we need to enter into Dynamics has been decided, reporting for management purposes and decisions is inaccurate and a waste of time."
I think most of my issues with red tape are localised issues that may not be representative of other offices and/or regions.
"local processes - where my area does not electrocially endorse decisions, still send out correspondence via mail and file hard copies. I anm aware otehr areas within DES do not do this and it a big time burden and unecessary in this day and age, particualy during COVID. Anyother exampl is a lack of confidence in COnnect which result in duplicate work bing required.  "
Duplication of work and time which would be better spent doing core job. 
electronic only. but need effective system to support this. 
"Delegations to approve establishment changes (eg, cost code, reporting t changes requiring Director approval)"
HR delegations
MECS/Corro team duplication in corro follow ups
MECS reminders are sent via people & system - unnecessary and email clogging. 
HR delegations too strict - wasting Directors time approving minor in house changes that dont have bottom line implications
Reduce HR delegations to Manager level
"Duplicate requests for reporting (eg. grants, finance, SDS etc.), same information requested from areas with different formats. DDO added to the duplication with little value to the business."
Duplicate requests for information - lack of coordination - consider more reasonable timeframes
Better coordination for corporate reporting processes to remove duplication
"review of corro team practises (sending reminders to MECS items that are already system generated reminders, or adding value elsewhere (eg, drafting standard corro/reporting instead of just forwarding on to work teams)"
Delegations- many processes are over-delegated e.g. Home Garaging for local vehicles having to go to a Manager for approval when that manager would have no idea what was operationally convenient or necessary.
"Over-delegated and complex processes for simply routine operations. Systems are not instinctive and confusing, We're all subject to a Code of Conduct so why are simple processes made so complex?"
Reduce delegations for approvals that are routine local operations.
"Administration, systems and 'red tape' are stifling this Department. It has taken over many roles which used to be operationally based. This has caused a serious lack of capacity at the 'doing' end of business."
"Too much briefing, inconsistent briefing processes,  "
"decisions essentially being made by those higher than needed,"
recruitment blockers (e.g. EMP)
Many are inefficient and need to go through too many people before a decision is made/something is approved. This also means that the person doing the actual work has to meet unrealistic timeframes for getting the job done to allow for others to review it. 
"In ESR, all external training requests had to go to SMT. This is no longer a requirements."
More trust need to be put in place for those who are delegated to make decisions (e.g. A08s).
"This is hard to write without identifying people.  However, there is a person in the command chain who insists on approving everything, even if someone lower down has the delegation to do so.   So say for example, we need a legal request submitted, it can be held up for a month waiting for someone higher up to approve, when someone lower down can approve it and would do so in a day or so.  This is just an example."
"getting approvals to have a report published.  we have had one sitting with an ED from another department for eight months, in our department one four months now, and another took at least six months to be approved.  It means that the reports are dated by the time they are released and it may lead to a perception things are being 'hidden' even though i know they are not."
there should be a turnaround time on approvals for scientific outputs.
"As stated, we are almost crippled by the approvals processes for reports and legal requests and other things other people are delegated to approve. It makes the department look bad as it takes so long for anything to happen or go out.  "
"Also, we are sometimes not informed of things (i.e. the new health and safety policy with sharks/crocs) and so plan and then things get stopped. If we had been informed different planning would occur. "
People who have delegations should be allowed to approve things.  
This is actually killing my teams morale.  We were asked to do a report and they worked really hard to finalise and interim report in December 2019. By August 2020 it hadn't been approved and I requested it be withdrawn as the final report was almost finished.  It is still sitting on MECS.  This makes it hard for my team to be motivated to work hard and finish things when we are told they are urgent.  People do not believe it now.
Approval processes for enforcement actions
Inefficient use of time obtaining approvals for enforcement actions that could be taken by Authorised Officers. 
Reduce number of endorsements/approvals required for enforcement actions
Managers not having sufficient time to review work and provide feedback to allow for timely progression of work. e.g. 2-8 weeks for comments
 travel approval
"Difficult to gain assist with Procurement, centralised and no training provided. "
"Adequate support for admin functions (e.g. more finance staff in EPP),"
" focus on managers doing 'management' work not project work, reduce project workload (recognise that FTE cap means we have to let somethings go), High level managers signing off in appriorate timeframes (project buy in and momentum with stakeholders is being negatively affected)"
"Stakeholders are losing faith that the department can deliver, projects take twice as long to deliver and the outcome is not as good as it could be. People spend more time becoming experts in every admin, procurement, finance and HR aspect of work instead of focusing on a particular role. Staff frustration at not being able to deliver on work and see outcomes is demoralising. "
Stand up agile meetings and tracking what approvals/reviews are sitting with managers to keep them accountable.
"Travel Approval form not centralised (ie: Finance Director, ED, DDG - Approval required). Which means email approvals can get lost, and accidentally removed from the email trail."
"Travel approvals, as noted above"
"Unnecessary chasing-up of lost email approvals. Extremely frustrating, especially for the staff needing to travel, when 4x approvals are required"
Not at DES.   ATO had automated approval form; which also included travellers expense reimbursement.  BEST PROCESS I have EVER experienced
Duplication is excessive  Sideways approvals required in some areas instead of upwards
Less micro-managing by upline management when process has been reviewed by managers
Too much focus is put on ensuring there are hard copy files of everything and lack of interest in esignatures from delegates. Adds an additional unnecessary amount of time ensuring paper copies are created electronically saved and mailed to the relevant file location if not in the office. 
hard copy filing.
takes longer to do all the administration than it does to do the actual work in some cases.
electronically based system where hard copies are only utilised where they MUST be.
Requested same information from different managers; excessive numbers of internal spreadsheets employed to capture data that is requested verbally anyway; these can be excessive to the point that they delay statutory work
In many instances we are performing the exact same task twice as it is done offline and then done online later.
Improvements to online approvals systems
"Start using MS365 more efficiently, via flows or apps - although we'd have to get ITP to allow us to utilise the full package - currently not available."
"Some approval processes are overly cautious, can often take long time for approval and require significant work to comply with."
Repetitive information and forms.
Automate process. Approve based on delegations. 
Not everything needs approval. Get rid of minor things that need approval.
Yes - please get managers to act in a timely fashion to approve any requests. Similar to in other organisations where managers take their role seriously.
Because it creates angst when the people involved seem like they are getting the run around and it affects decisions and timeliness of outcomes. Every level has there fudge factor timeline that demoralises the person the process is about.
Decision makers make decisions rather than problem/paper shuffle.
Over escalation of simple decisions
Decent modern automated systems that reduce back and foward
DDO reporting
Too many levels of approval required which delays meeting deadlines
To streamline approvals and make approvals quicker in order to meet deadline
There should be a KPI on turnaround times.
No Branch wide Admin support. Everyone/every team manages there own admin and HR processes. 
 no rules enforced around travel lead to serious breaches of travel policy. 
Corp Comms alter work of content experts too heavily resulting in lengthy colloboration. 
Managing taking weeks/months to action work.
